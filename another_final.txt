fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron has everything fans have been waiting for. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	The Avengers return in an epic adventure with a little romance and tragedy to keep the spectacle grounded.
fresh	Age of Ultron is not disappointing but it is definitely not better the first one. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	I began to forget the breathless, teetering, tottering, careening, catapulting Avengers: The Age Of Ultron about 20 minutes into its 141 minutes... Zoom, quip, wham, smirk, quip, blam! Quip! Oh so much too-muchness on an inhumane scale.
rotten	It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?
rotten	The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore.
rotten	[The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters.
fresh	As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if they're putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine.
rotten	When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?
fresh	Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward.
fresh	Though advertised as a darker and more brooding follow-up, the real surprise of Ultron is how much in line with the first film's tone and structural beats this is.
fresh	It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human.
fresh	A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
fresh	The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that it's reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties.
fresh	It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it.
fresh	There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw.
rotten	Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
fresh	Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now.
fresh	Whedon is still Whedon, and the grace notes -- the snappy patter, the team dynamics, the "man, that was cool" moments -- go a long way.
fresh	Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.
fresh	The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball.
rotten	That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that "Ultron" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder.
fresh	The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movie's very elegant fluidity rests ...
fresh	At this point the Marvel superhero movies are as machine-tooled as a Prius, and this one sticks closely to the blueprint that's made them box office titans.
fresh	You can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first "Avengers," has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life.
fresh	With Marvel's universe expanding and intertwining at an ever increasing rate, "Age of Ultron" feels less like a sequel than a cosmic event.
fresh	Regardless, this time with Avengers: Age of Ultron, our socks were only tugged on, halfway flopping off our collective toes, but never blown quite off.
rotten	More of the same, just not as good--lots of sound and fury (along with some Fury) signifying very little.
fresh	Whedon is as interested in how the team works under stress as he is in the way pavement cracks under the collective weight of the Hulk and Stark's Hulkbuster armor.
fresh	By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms, franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs: a dollop of charm.
fresh	As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own.
fresh	"Age of Ultron" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop.
fresh	Whedon's wit and invention are considerable...[but] the movies keep getting bigger, with diminishing returns. I find myself hoping against hope that Ant-Man will be really, really small.
fresh	As he did in the first "Avengers," writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun.
fresh	Spader is so charismatic, so purely, quietly and wittily nasty, that he provides a welcome contrast to the rote wisecracking of our heroes, who are so busy trying to one-up each others' punchlines that they are beginning to come off like "Avengers' 11."
fresh	Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment.
rotten	A whole bunch of blather leads up to the same old climax with imperiled innocents and massive destruction.
fresh	Age of Ultron is a feast of visual delights, but plot wears thin. If Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), who are now taking over the Avengers series, want to keep the audience fully invested, some re-Assembly is required.
fresh	More bloated, but bolder than its predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron is every bit the 11th entry in Marvel's winning, world-dominating formula.
fresh	It's one you're going to want to see because when it shines, it shines bright, but Avengers: Age of Ultron is just a little worrying that the universe is already buckling under its own weight.
fresh	Okay as a diversion but nowhere close to matching any number of other singular superhero movies. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	...the film starts out attempting to question the Avengers' place in the world and whether they really make a difference, only to forget to probe for an answer not long after the asking.
fresh	There seems to be a lot of pressure for Avengers: Age of Ultron to more than just a movie, which really hampers its ability to be a movie.
rotten	There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going.
rotten	Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him.
fresh	Director Joss Whedon follows up his billion-dollar superhero smash the way most sequel makers try to up their game: by amping up everything everybody liked the first time around, plus more! More! More!
fresh	...a comic book movie, to be sure, but it's got enough spectacle, wit, and talent on display to make it a most entertaining kickoff to the season.
rotten	Black Widow chooses the Hulk over Thor? Females everywhere say "Huh?" The Avengers show absolutely no interest in each other. AGE OF ULTRON is soulless.
fresh	Talk about feeding the beast. Josh Whedon's never dull chapter in the franchise is practically bursting at its seams, relentlessly serving up just what the fans of this brand are expecting.
fresh	Age of Ultron can be a little unwieldy, but when it works, it works really well.
fresh	An entertaining package of characters and ideas that manages to be a whole lot more than the first film while also being a little bit less.
fresh	The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
fresh	It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom.
rotten	Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length.
fresh	A middling film, yet it's so heavy with Joss Whedon's sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in --- which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment.
fresh	Sometimes the super-heroism is just brightly colored junk food. And sometimes, it's a way of giving us a glimpse of how we flawed, messed-up, occasionally monstrous humans can sometimes prove ourselves worthy.
fresh	It feels as if this comic book franchise has become a never-ending cinema story. If future films are as well realized as Ultron, that's fine by me.
fresh	It would be silly to pretend that Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't good at what it does, that it's not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron may be very similar to the original film, but that's ok, for it still results in an equally thrilling ride.
fresh	The climactic act of "Age of Ultron" is full of colossal ka-booms and special effects, but it also has heft and reason and a bass-note of emotion.
fresh	It's a little overstuffed and a little overlong. One thing it's not, even a little, is disappointing.
fresh	Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic.
rotten	Darker than its predecessor [and] far less witty ... Whereas Stark seemed to dominate the first film, here the emphasis is ... Hawkeye and Black Widow ... a negative in the case of Hawkeye and a huge positive in the case of Black Widow.
fresh	Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.
fresh	Like the first one, Avengers: Age of Ultron was written and directed by Joss Whedon, among whose many virtues is an indelible, infallible touch with character, which is important because in Ultron he has to introduce them at a furious rate.
rotten	Ultron is too full, of action and CGI, while also being nearly empty of genuine thrills. A talented cast impresses throughout, but the action ultimately overwhelms it.
fresh	Whedon is mostly up to the task of keeping all his balls in the air, though he's not above using some glib speechmaking and ridiculous action to divert your attention and keep your questions at bay.
fresh	This is Joss Whedon's riff on the trope of a darker sequel. Joss Whedon never met a cliche he couldn't deconstruct so this is a wonderful approach to a shared universe superhero team up.
rotten	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real.
fresh	The movie's brain quickly catches up with its big body, and writer-director Joss Whedon tops his 2012 outing with a more emotional sequel.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron has its problems, but on a visceral, pure enjoyment level audiences are going to walk away more than pleased.
rotten	An inferior sequel that brings little joy to its grandiosity, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" carries the vague aroma of uninspired, box-checking functionality.
fresh	Joss Whedon brings along his "A" game for this installment, and it doesn't disappoint.
fresh	The only thing that adequately distinguishes these films is the all-important banter that occurs during down time.
fresh	An enjoyable, full-sensory superhero romp, it delivers no less than what one would expect from an Avengers film. At the same time, it delivers no more than that,either.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" brings the best of all the Marvel worlds for the first explosive superhero thrill-ride of the year.
rotten	Enough fight scenes and action sequences for three Marvel movies, but they are rather nondescript.
rotten	Spectacularly overstuffed - it's more spectacle than substance.
fresh	Joss Whedon and his heroes and villains epic offers more this time around -- more characters, more plot points, more action -- and a few reasons for concern.
fresh	Still light and funny, but the novelty's worn off, and the bloat and repetition are starting to show
fresh	There is much to like about "The Avengers: Age of Ultron." There was much to love about "The Avengers," and therein lies the difference.
rotten	Writing and directing "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own: mediocrity.
fresh	Lovable characters, just the right amount of humor and spectacular action make "Ultron" a worthy bridge to whatever happens next in The Avengers' universe.
rotten	Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems.
fresh	[I] loved most of the exchanges between the characters. Appreciated the Avengers' attempts to avoid destruction in population centers. The action scenes were very exciting and clever, but I had trouble keeping up with the visuals.
rotten	Joss Whedon sets up the future of the Avengers for the Russo Brothers, but this is no longer exciting. It's exhausting.
rotten	Sure, this is the A Team of comic book superstars, but overextended sequences don't make them any more impressive.
rotten	Age of Ultron, then, shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedon's imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth).
fresh	Joss Whedon shows his considerable gifts for multicharacter air traffic control in a massive 3-D spectacle while demonstrating reserves of insouciance.
fresh	Whedon gets the elastic physical reality of comic books, and he knows how to frame a shot as though it were a splash panel come to life... But by the fifth digital showdown, the endless CGI spectacle begins to feel a little numbing.
fresh	Ultron is slyly funny. And it manages to balance this sort of comedy (I hooted when the Hulk listens to Maria Callas on headphones) with the tendency towards the sort of whacko-labyrinthine operatic complexity inherent in comic books.
fresh	No one can quibble with the efforts of the actors. Marvel cast well, and continues to expand their parts or add fascinating new players.
fresh	Everything [Whedon] did so well on the first meeting of these Marvel comic book creations he achieves once again, which makes for a movie both enjoyable and somewhat repetitive.
fresh	"Age of Ultron" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets, levitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie.
fresh	Entertaining as much of "Avengers 2" is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the "Guardians of the Galaxy" lesson, learned), Whedon's picture meets expectations without exceeding them.
rotten	Thin on story, crowded with characters and padded with extraneous action. In other words, a sure hit!
rotten	Ultron maintains Marvel's record for solid, entertaining blockbusters but falls down a bit in the "making sense" department.
rotten	Most of these characters are great fun, and there are still stories to tell. So why not do it, instead of telling and retelling the same tale, only bigger?
rotten	A lot of movie, where not a lot is special.
rotten	The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point.
rotten	Its problems may not have been so evident if it wasn't trying so hard to surpass the far better movies that preceded it.
fresh	This movie is fine, honestly. I rather liked it.
fresh	Pure, uncut comic-book fantasy...Whedon tames the beast into something spectacularly epic, if a bit exhausting: bursting with destructive mayhem but grounded by interesting character beats, rife with dark implications but seasoned with good humor.
rotten	At times it feels like it's a few handfuls of terrific actors away from being a 'Transformers' entry.
fresh	While it does feel rushed, and the overabundance of characters threatens to impede the focus, I was constantly engaged with the strong dialogue, humor and breathtaking action.
fresh	It aims to please. And, for the most part, this superhero extravaganza hits the bull's-eye with all the precision of Jeremy Renner's arrow-slinging Hawkeye.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a kinetic, wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks.
rotten	First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn't worth the sweat.
rotten	Having bent the world to his will, Whedon, a modest and self-deprecating talent, has helped Marvel unleash a form of spectacle-laden blockbuster that, unfortunately, seems intent on obliterating what he does best.
fresh	Whedon may still be a maverick but the Marvel behemoth proves an ever more levelling corporate force.
rotten	141 minutes of noise and incident.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" lives up to the hype...it gets darker than the first, and still manages to be just as funny and action-packed.
fresh	The chemistry amongst our heroes is once again terrific to watch, and the action sequences deliver both thrills and laughs.
fresh	It suffers from a bit of Transformersitis in laying on the action and effects too thick this time. The thrill may be gone in seeing these comic book icons together but the banter between them still works and it does have its moments of sheer fun.
fresh	There are only so many superhero smackdowns a body can take before it all becomes biff bam bore... the film is most entertaining when it finds the Avengers kicking back rather than kicking off, hanging around off duty and indulging in locker-room banter .
rotten	It was like Whedon thought about the 1st film and felt it wasn't deep enough, not realizing that its success was its comic book shallowness. It was just fun for audiences.
fresh	When it reaches its extended climax, however, Age of Ultron perfectly delivers huge action scenes with the requisite smaller heroic beats.
fresh	Whedon takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word.
rotten	When movies such as this come along which feel more like financial investments than stories, that's what you get: production line filmmaking in which human beings are incidental and even unnecessary in the face of computer-generated scale and spectacle.
fresh	No one needs to be told if he, or even she, likes superhero movies. If you like them at all, you'll adore Avengers: Age of Ultron.
fresh	Avengers: Age Of Ultron is smart, nimble and recognises that the one way to make yet more scenes of mass destruction involving is to give the story behind them a little heart.
fresh	Proves an action movie can have it all: smart without being convoluted, flashy without being shallow, fun without being hollow, and exciting without being dumb.
fresh	Despite a densely packed script chock-full of leading characters, there's rarely a moment where one is underplayed or ignored.
fresh	Although there are some longeurs when Whedon feels bound to plot a pathway to Marvel's next tranche of potential blockbusters, the witty repartee between stars at ease in their superhero skin leavens the odd lull.
fresh	When ten-cylinder push comes to jet-propelled shove, Whedon knows his audience, and supplies the required fireworks.
rotten	Like a magnificent cake sliced into too many slivers, the movie is at once too much and never quite enough.
fresh	Whedon wastes no time teaming them up for a blistering opening sequence that is thrilling. Unfortunately that segment is a high point in a film that swiftly becomes an exercise in ever-diminishing returns bar a few moments.
fresh	I walked out of the theater feeling like the survivor of an all-you-can-eat buffet.
fresh	The fact that Marvel announced its entire slate a few months back takes a lot of the impact away. If we didn't know about a Black Panther film, the mention of Wakanda would have been mind-blowing. Instead, it fell flat.
rotten	Any true drama is entirely missing. There is no tension. Everything has to stop for the next battle. It is tediously repetitive. And the characters are all one defining trait.
fresh	Marvel consistently puts out entertaining films which work towards a common goal - which is why it's mystifying that Avengers: Age of Ultron, nominally the best entry in phase two, is only mildly entertaining by comparison.
rotten	The film-makers' understandable inability to take their own material seriously has now pushed the project beyond gentle parody and into broad pastiche.
fresh	Not without problems, but continues the Avengers tradition of big, bold blockbusters that don't need to toss away thoughtfulness to remain pure popcorn fun.
rotten	The movie's action sequences and sequel-baiting suck up much of its oxygen, and the magnitude of battles dwarf the smaller moments.
fresh	Filled with plenty of laughs, great spectacle, and more cool characters than you can poke Loki's sceptre at.
fresh	Even though moviegoers looking for nonstop action will get their wish, Avengers: Age of Ultron is really at its best when it's focusing on the characters.
rotten	In many ways, Marvel has grown up and passed Whedon by - and his jocular take on the material doesn't just feel stale, it feels like a step back.
fresh	[N]ails the feeling of sitting and reading a stack of eight comics in one sitting
fresh	Marvel's latest is its biggest, baddest installment yet, but it's the little moments that make it work - in part, because Joss Whedon is so good at them.
fresh	It's hard not to admire how efficiently and enjoyably the myriad elements have been threaded together; Age of Ultron is a suitably well-oiled machine with an insatiable appetite for family friendly destruction.
rotten	A $250 million pile of poo.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is a perfect example of the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster that audiences expect in this day and age, though I don't think it will achieve classic-status like the first film.
fresh	Whedon weaves theses titanic characters and egos together to bind the bloated universe into a Long Island Iced Tea; the more you savour, the more you come to appreciate all the powerful and seemingly conflicting elements and motivations working together.
fresh	The symphony of destruction works because this blockbuster behemoth has an actual soul.
fresh	Despite the overall enjoyment factor of the film, with this, its eleventh film, writer-director Joss Whedon seems intent on pushing some of Marvel Films' more tiresome elements to the extreme.
fresh	Avengers: Age Of Ultron is a big, bold, funny, thrilling, absorbing triumph, and continues Marvel Studios' seeming push for world cinematic domination.
rotten	Avengers: Age of Ultron, is a letdown -- entertaining to a degree, but so overstuffed that it may mark the point of diminishing returns for the Marvel movies generally.
rotten	While the visuals are extraordinary and the wry humour is welcome, what's missing is a coherent story with light and shade
fresh	You'd be surprised how much slack you'll cut a film that features superheroes gently ribbing one another for 142 minutes.
fresh	Fortunately, returning director Joss Whedon understands how to craft a superhero movie just as well as Marvel knows how to sell one.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron delivers the usual superhero suspects in a slick, if overlong, adventure that bungee jumps between banter and action.
fresh	Whedon brings a depth and wit to his storytelling that you will never find in a Transformers movie. Even so, the final showdown is a little anti-climactic.
rotten	It's hard to muster the attention span to care about Earth's Mightiest Heroes when we know they'll just be back to do it all again in a few years.
fresh	A welcome return of the Avengers amusing team dynamic and essentially asking "what more could you want?"
fresh	An entertaining compromise. Overloaded, but the execution of intimate character moments shine in what's essentially a bridging film
fresh	While "Avengers: Age Of Ultron" isn't perfect, and arguably less successful than "The Avengers," on a purely enjoyable moviegoing level, it should please fans hardcore and casual alike, and that's maybe that's all that really matters in the end.
fresh	In the moments where it all comes together, like the sure-to-be-iconic Hulkbuster sequence, this is the very model of what Marvel's been chasing since day one.
rotten	Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do.
rotten	It looks great, but haven't we been here before?
fresh	Marvel movie die-hards will come away having found nuggets of pleasure, but those who complain about superhero sagas will find plenty to support their arguments here.
fresh	Ultimately, Avengers: Age of Ultron can't recapture the charm and majesty of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled for the first time. That said, it's still a lot of fun and offers plenty of great action and character moments.
fresh	The result is a lot of everything, but the film never feels overcrowded: in fact, it's the interplay between the film's many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they're trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
fresh	Giddy good fun as the Marvel movies consistently are-Age of Ultron's many battles swoop and clang nicely-they're no longer novel.
fresh	It's a superhero cavalcade of energy and fun.
fresh	Bigger and, yes, darker than the first, this is less air-punchingly gleeful but probably more consistent.
fresh	It doesn't have the fist-pumping highs of the first film, but AGE OF ULTRON is deeper, more emotional and all-around better.
fresh	There's a lot to like about Age of Ultron, but the coolest thing about it is the way it reclaims the comic book part of the phrase 'comic-book movie.'
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up ...
fresh	Whedon and his large, capable cast (even larger for this follow-up) deliver enough adventure, laughs and flat-out spectacle to ensure that audiences will feel as if they have gotten their money's worth ...
fresh	It ticks all the boxes for a summer blockbuster but you feel spandex fatigue is just being to creep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	There is so much going on in Avengers: Age of Ultron ... it feels like a minor miracle that not only the film makes sense, but that it's also somehow enjoyable.
fresh	Anchored by Whedon's trademark wit without becoming a tiresome zinger-fest, it's a thrilling and affable slice of impeccably crafted chaos.
fresh	As gargantuan as blockbusters come ... doubles down on action, sarcasm, and reference-heavy plot.
fresh	It has a definite mid-season feel to it, telling a compelling but never game-changing story while laying the foundations for the epic, two-part Infinity War due in 2018.
rotten	If you're happy to, as they say, just turn your brain off and watch your heroes fight, it's fine...But Marvel has set me up to expect stories a bit above that base level
fresh	If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, "Age of Ultron" most definitely has soul.
fresh	Massive, immersive and wildly entertaining, Age of Ultron gets the gang back together for a globe-trotting battle against a meager villain. Fun will be had by all.
fresh	Improves on its predecessor on many fronts even if it doesn't fully recapture the magic of the 2012 endeavour.
fresh	Age of Ultron [is] one of the most thoughtfully driven monster vehicles you are likely to see in a summer rammed with powerful, glossy, mechanised beasts.
fresh	A gooey plate of nachos that shouldn't constitute your whole diet, but is perfectly enjoyable for now, even when as congeals at the end into a wet, sloppy mess.
fresh	It is likely that this is the best Avengers movie that we'll ever see.
fresh	James Spader, another living, breathing reason we need a special award for voice work and casting at the Oscars because he was just the perfect choice for everything that Ultron had to offer and performed it incredibly.
fresh	The stakes on the line in this action adventure are not only sky-high but soul-deep. Whedon hits both points with an almighty wallop, resulting in a large canvas blockbuster that is as epic as it is profound.
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	The only grace note in this otherwise determinedly graceless movie is the classy way Walker's exit is handled. To say more is to say too much.
fresh	I have never once, not ever, been genuinely disappointed in a The Fast and the Furious movie. It is, by far, the most satisfying franchise in American action cinema... That being said, something is very slightly off in Furious 7.
fresh	Furious 7 is exactly what most popular movies are today: behemoth amusement rides adding more preposterous loop-de-loops with each sequel because nothing succeeds like excess. No brand does that better than the Fast & Furious franchise.
rotten	The latest instalment of the franchise cost a pretty penny, yet often feels less like a slick blockbuster than a demented day-time soap.
fresh	A masterful cavalcade of carefully orchestrated vehicular mayhem, a dose of high-octane escapism ramped up to ridiculous, fantastical extremes.
fresh	Furious 7 kicks the biggest and hardest, but it's far from the best.
fresh	This is an immensely entertaining movie, and if the filmmakers are wise, they'll quit on this high note.
fresh	It's Mission: Impossible with extra emphasis on "impossible," & a gleeful anarchistic disregard for how often it jumps the shark (& a few skyscrapers) because it's having too much damn fun to care.
fresh	Trust me when I say absolutely nothing's been left out of Furious 7. A thrill ride from beginning to end.
rotten	It's time to come back to earth, which this film only does in its memorial coda to Paul Walker, a fine sendoff which doesn't take the road most traveled.
fresh	he stunts are pure insanity, and the best part is, even though I'm sure there is a sizable helping of digital effects involved, there is a lot of actual, old-fashioned stunt work on the screen ...
fresh	Suspension of disbelief is a must and watching Paul Walker in his last movie is like watching a ghost. It's uncomfortable at times.
fresh	Overall, it's a job well done and, ultimately, a fitting tribute to both the late actor and his character. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Furious 7 is everything you expect it to be. An over-the-top car chase film jam packed with fist fights, gun battles, insanely awesome set pieces and lots of dialog about family.
fresh	State-of-the-art automotive uproar, room-wrecking MMA-style smack-downs, and wild stunts performed by real live people.
fresh	Soap opera with supercars and explosions. Pitch perfect tribute to Paul Walker. What's not to love?
fresh	Furious 7 has so much adrenaline and testosterone that women who see the movie could become pregnant.
rotten	...lazy and annoying, devoid of any hint of what might have once made it interesting. But that is not to say that there aren't exciting moments, it's just that none of them add up to anything we care about.
fresh	If you gave a 15-year-old boy $250million and told him to go away and make a movie, the result would probably look like this.
fresh	It's not a magnificent seven but fans will certainly lap it up.
rotten	It's all entertaining enough, I suppose. But there's a twisted coldness under the action that's anxiously concealed by the characters' refrains of the importance of "family" and sticking together and other ostensibly nice stuff.
fresh	The real stars of these films are the bonkers action setpieces, and "Furious 7" achieves new high points in that department.
fresh	It's not the best "Furious" but it's far from the worst.
fresh	The story is an appropriately flimsy excuse for a series of undercards - Statham vs. Rock, Tony Jaa vs. Paul Walker (twice), Michelle Rodriguez vs. Ronda Rousey.
fresh	It's all dumb, but it's wonderfully, comfortably dumb in just the right way.
fresh	The brashest, noisiest, most ludicrously outrageous in the series so far. No surprises there... What is unexpected is quite how tender and poignant the film should turn out to be, a touching farewell to departed star Paul Walker.
fresh	Furious 7 is basically a live action version of Grand Theft Auto, with a touching tribute to its fallen star - Paul Walker.
fresh	This is a franchise where the filmmakers and stars willingly embrace the absurd so going in your motto should be 'everything is impossible, but awesome.'
fresh	Fun, exciting and emotionally involving, this sequel delivers the best qualities of this series and a stirring tribute to the late Paul Walker.
fresh	"Over-the-top" doesn't cut it as a descriptor for these movies any more - there needs to be an adjective for whatever is above "over-the-top", because that's what F&F7 is.
fresh	Though its respect for road safety or, indeed, logic, is flimsy at best, Fast & Furious 7 is also an undeniably enjoyable ride.
fresh	It's perhaps fitting that the best part of Furious 7 is that it has drive. This is a film that knows what it wants to be, and it delivers it both with impact and precision.
fresh	The monster muscle-car franchise continues to relentlessly assault the senses in this globe-trotting sequel, with horror maestro James Wan's direction adding extra high-style brilliance to proceedings.
fresh	"Cars don't fly!" is the recurring cry in Fast and Furious 7 and in scene after improbably hilarious heavy-metal crashing scene, this idea is disproved.
rotten	Spectacular action, chases, races and fight scenes are combined with plotting and dialogue of mind-numbing crudity and plenty of shameless product placement in the latest sequel.
rotten	What transpires is grimmer than what's come before, and without the sense of fun, the absurdity of the action becomes less enjoyable.
fresh	Superior set pieces continue to sustain this most dumbly enjoyable of franchises ...
fresh	leaves us hoping for more four wheel mayhem in the future
fresh	A remarkably satisfying and entertaining action movie, one of the best in the series. Put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.
fresh	Furious Seven may only be 'good' by way of the [Howard] Hawks Rule, but nonetheless, it's damn good at what it sets out to do.
fresh	The movie doesn't hold together as well as the previous chapter, but that's really a function of expanding the cast still further.
fresh	A number of the sequences verge on the obscene, in terms of credibility, and if you thought these films disregarded the laws of physics in the past, well, Wan has simply gone ahead and dispensed with them.
fresh	Furious Seven provides what viewers have come to expect from the long-running The Fast and the Furious series: a string of high-octane, physics-defying action scenes loosely connected by a narrative that occasionally makes rudimentary sense.
fresh	The film follows an exceedingly well-traveled road, though the formula-a crew of racer-adventurers who put dual premiums on speed and family values-has been spiked with ever more spectacular, or preposterous, effects.
rotten	A huge, galumphing bore...the maelstrom of mayhem very quickly becomes an orgy of stupidity, and a remarkably tedious one at that.
fresh	For a franchise known for cheesy, heavy-handed lines, Furious 7 served up a classy, heartbreaking send-off for its departed star, one that acknowledged the tragedy of real life without allowing it to overwhelm the fictional world.
fresh	Those actors are good. But the movie survives and thrives on big explosions and even bigger explosions.
fresh	Although it's too long by a good 30 minutes, watching Furious 7 is about as much fun as you can legally, safely, and sanely have without crashing your own Lykan Hypersport through Abu Dhabi's famed Etihad Towers complex.
rotten	The story takes place in LA, Abu Dhabi, Tokyo, and the Caucasus Mountains, yet Wan has so few ideas about how to choreograph and edit action that the elaborate stunt sequences all feel exactly the same.
fresh	Furious 7 is incapable of being indictable: it's pure popcorn escapism, brashly dumb and knowing at the same time. Like its central muscleheads, the film is aware it's breaking all the rules.
fresh	This combination of the earnest with the ridiculous is exactly how Fast & Furious draws you in.
fresh	If it turns out that this really is the last Fast & Furious film, it's a good note to go out on.
fresh	Watching Furious 7... one gets the distinct impression that, when faced with a creative choice, the filmmakers asked themselves, "What's the most insane, over-the-top thing we can do here?"
fresh	The ramrod-serious Diesel and Statham sell the dialogue, anyway. So do the more lighthearted Johnson and Tyrese Gibson. Johnson and Gibson wring laughs from obvious jokes. The acting champ of 7, though, is Michelle Rodriguez.
fresh	When a film is this exciting in its action set pieces and this meaningful in its quiet moments, the filmmakers are getting it right.
fresh	James Wan embraces the series' visual hallmarks with what translates to unencumbered glee onscreen.
rotten	The grunted catch-phrases, the implausible escapes, the plot holes the size of the Bonneville Salt Flats - it's all pitched at a particular audience like a dog whistle that fully grown humans can't hear.
fresh	At this rate, the next chapter will have to take place in outer space. Fast & Furious: Venusian Drift.
fresh	It took seven movies, but "Furious Seven" can be counted as the franchise's first unequivocal success, a go-for-broke extravaganza of gripping tension, unbelievably wild stuntwork, and a beating heart that doesn't feel prefabricated.
rotten	This is a cockamamie amalgamation of absurd car chases, ridiculous fights, and more noise than you can tolerate blasting away at you for almost 2 1/2 hours with no coherent plot or raison d'etre outside of big box office.
fresh	Start your engines.
fresh	"Furious 7" buzzes with a frenetic energy so contagious, there's no sense in resisting it. Like its predecessors, this film has no shame about being its high-octane, gloriously ridiculous self.
fresh	If you've bought into the series overall thus far, you're not going to want to miss Paul Walker's final ride.
fresh	"Furious 7" is not as zippy as "Fast Five," my favorite of the ones I've seen, but it has its satisfactions; its global audience is built-in, as well as strapped in and ready to ride.
fresh	Some things succeed without being an outstanding achievement. Larry the Cable Guy, Justin Bieber, Spam. To that cavalcade, let us add the likable, repetitive, chaotic "Furious Seven."
fresh	This one sticks with you. Forget the plot bumps, muscle acting, and tweet-length dialogue. Finishing the film in Paul Walker's honor clearly brought out the best in everyone.
rotten	In Furious 7, the unstoppable Fast and the Furious franchise sputters and stalls, edging from spectacular, tongue-in-cheek B-movie fun to soulless, insulting inanity.
rotten	Big and numbingly loud, "Furious 7" jets around the globe so we can watch cars crash, explode and repeatedly defy gravity. If that sounds like a great way to spend two hours and 17 minutes, read no more.
fresh	It's the kind of movie in which the endlessly antagonistic villain and hero express their boiling hatred by driving head-on into each other's rides. At high speed. Twice.
rotten	Physics and Gravity be Damned! "Furious 7" Aims to Please.
fresh	Loud, long and laughably over-the-top, Furious 7 is one of the best pure action movies ever made.
fresh	For their seventh adventure, the Fast & Furious cast and crew continue to outdo themselves with mind-boggling stunt driving and outrageous action mayhem...
fresh	Furious 7 is so giddy and overblown that its bloated runtime is more of a blessing than a burden.
fresh	Hey, action flicks aren't supposed to make you cry!
fresh	The nicest thing I can say about Furious 7 is that if it were the end of the franchise, it'd be a fine and fitting one.
rotten	Alternately entertaining and annoying.
fresh	As long as you're willing to buckle your seat belt, disengage your brain and just go along for the ride, there's also no small amount of fun to be had.
rotten	As for the plot, there is one. As for the acting, it's there in the sense that actors are onscreen moving around and saying words that don't make sense.
fresh	James Wan came up in the horror ranks and gave the world the first Saw... If "F&F" fans feared that he would tamper with the box-office formula and end up slaying and gutting this cinematic golden goose for shocks and giggles, they can rest easy.
fresh	Delivers the goods, and then some.
rotten	Here and there, we get the imaginative and outrageous stunts this series is famous for, but mostly the movie plods along, muscling through without much life or spirit.
fresh	"Furious 7" is the fuel-injected fusion of all that is and ever has been good in "The Fast and the Furious" saga that began in 2001 with souped-up cars and a stripped-down story about a tightknit East L.A. street racing crew.
fresh	The series will doubtless continue on with Diesel, Rodriguez, Johnson, and the rest, but in the meantime, Furious 7 comes to the most conclusive and emotionally satisfying ending since, fittingly, the very first film.
rotten	Head-slappingly stupid
fresh	Kind of like the Avengers, only more racially diverse, and marginally less bound by the laws of physics or common sense.
fresh	You're left wondering if there is such a thing as too much.
fresh	Yes, "Furious Seven" is incredible. I spent just about the entire running time either with a huge smile on my face or cackling hysterically.
rotten	It turns out 2011's "Fast Five" wasn't a turning point for the series, just a wildly entertaining fluke.
fresh	Furious 7 offers edge-of-the-seat excitement with outlandish action sequences, inventive stunts, hilarious cartoonish moments and even some touching emotion.
fresh	It is, perhaps, the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie aren't mutually exclusive.
fresh	There will no doubt be better movies released in 2015, but "Furious 7" is an early favorite to win the prize for most picture.
fresh	There's so much destruction at the climax that it's like an apocalypse with a happy ending. Furious 7 is the demon love child of Fast & Furious 6 and a Mad Max movie.
fresh	...if the series gives in to its worst impulses going forward, we fans have a good, satisfying stopping point.
fresh	All laws of velocity, geometry and air-traffic control are so flagrantly disobeyed, you just won't be able to wipe the dopey grin off your face.
fresh	The sheer implausibility is entertaining, yet it feels as if nothing is really at stake: everyone has nine lives.
rotten	This is Wan's first major Hollywood production after more than a decade of profitable horror outings including Saw and Insidious, and it's disappointing that neither the gonzo gore of the former nor the calculating restraint of the latter register here.
fresh	It's an enormous, steroidal blast, and as much ingenious fun as a blockbuster can be.
fresh	This is the pinnacle, people. This is everything they've got.
fresh	Fast-moving fight scenes, outrageous auto antics and a sprinkling of ridiculous one-liners make Furious 7 a campy, crowd-pleasing escape.
fresh	'Furious 6' was "dumb fun" to a breaking point. 'Furious 7' revives the franchise with cohesion and elegance.
fresh	Seventh entry in the high-octane franchise won't disappoint fans, and serves as a moving tribute to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The most gleefully meat-headed franchise going has intersected with real-life tragedy and handled it with surprising grace. Meat-headed grace, sure, but grace nonetheless.
fresh	I daresay Furious 7 is best of the lot since the original. Fasten your seatbelts, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride!
fresh	A slim excuse, and a perfectly good one, for trotting around the globe, blowing up drones in Los Angeles and sending Lebanese sports cars crashing through Abu Dhabi skyscrapers.
fresh	The good news is that Furious 7 offers more - and more, and yet more - of the same.
fresh	It lays bare that the franchise's most radical asset is also its most conservative: an overriding emphasis on, above all else, the on-screen family.
fresh	There won't be a faster, more furious movie this year.
fresh	You'll end up so unashamedly engrossed by Furious 7 that you'll forgive its blatant disregard of narrative, subtlety and gravity and just enjoy and appreciate the rollicking ride for what it is.
fresh	It certainly aims to be no less than the ultimate action movie, which, for some filmgoers, translates into the ultimate movie, period.
fresh	"Furious 7" is the biggest, silliest movie in the "Fast and Furious" franchise, officially transforming the series into "The Avengers" with muscle cars. But what's wrong with big and silly?
rotten	Car racing, vengeance, logic-defying stunts and stuff blowing up. Too much stuff blowing up, really. We came for the cars and their reckless, gorgeous drivers; we can get explosions anywhere.
fresh	Screeching incomprehensibly from one stunt-filled set piece to the next, Fast And Furious 7 is an exuberantly high-octane ride across a ridiculously elaborate plot.
fresh	Ranks a very successful fourth place overall, with at least one gargantuan set piece that ranks among the series' finest.
fresh	A group more bulletproof than The Avengers, causing more mayhem than General Zod. Think Universal doesn't have a superhero franchise? Think again.
fresh	This film isn't taking itself too seriously, and it certainly doesn't expect us to.
rotten	Too long, too convoluted, too sentimental, and too ridiculous. Some will say those are its good points. Will they embrace the homoeroticism too?
fresh	Furious 7 hits every note that it must to satisfy fans and effectively pay tribute to Walker in his final on-screen performance.
fresh	"Furious 7" isn't so much goodbye as it is merely the end of something.
fresh	Nothing is impossible in his no holds barred thrilling actioner in which cars leap from planes, skyscrapers and cliff-tops as stunts accelerate to levels that almost break the sound barrier
rotten	"The logic-free, consequence-free property damage is never very involving. Furious 7 is sure to be the most lucrative entry of the series. But if you give it any thought at all, it will leave you feeling carsick."
fresh	Everything about F&F 7 is supersized, from the actors to the running time to the scope of urban destruction.
fresh	So fast, furious, ginormous, crazed, maxed-out and heart-on-sleeve emotional is this gloriously ludicrous instalment that it's impossible to see where an eighth could go.
fresh	The face-to-face punch-ups are a lot of fun. The Statham-Johnson smackdown resembles nothing more than two shaved pitbulls in a tumble dryer.
fresh	The final shot could not be more perfect. Tears will be shed.
fresh	I found myself unexpectedly shedding a tear at the film's perfectly judged, sunbathed, final fade to white.
fresh	Diesel & Statham test each other's manhood by playing a game of car chicken, smashing into each other at maximum velocity in a tunnel - Furious 7 is the Large Hardon Collider.
rotten	"Furious 7" finds the franchise at an unwanted crossroads, but it makes such a play for the diehard fans that it leaves everyone else at somewhat of a loss.
fresh	It's impossible to watch Furious 7 and not think about [Paul] Walker the entire time. And as much as I enjoyed Furious 7 ... I found myself feeling incredibly sad. Most of the time, it feels like one long goodbye.
fresh	Furious 7 knows its audience and delivers exactly what they want, including an exciting last act with a huge pay-off.
fresh	The hit muscle-car franchise does itself and the late Paul Walker proud with a solid seventh entry.
fresh	Furious 7 is the perfect popcorn movie and there is no better way they could have paid tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	The most over-the-top sequences the filmmakers could imagine, and each one is as fun as the last.
fresh	The filmmakers are well aware of how silly this franchise has become. They're more than happy to keep the good times rolling, just so long as they can keep finding new and amusing ways in which to drive cars irresponsibly and destroy buildings at will.
fresh	Stupendously stupid and stupidly diverting.
fresh	As a relentlessly paced action movie, Furious 7 is an excellent entry for those who would appreciate this sort of thing. As a memorial for one of its own, it's about as affecting as big, loud, ridiculous action movies get.
fresh	Furious 7 is an in-your-face assault of awesomeness under the guidance of James Wan, who saves a more lax story by orchestrating a metallic ballet of kick-ass proportions.
fresh	A fitting and moving send-off for Walker that still delivers the knowingly absurd stunts that Fast fans have come to expect.
rotten	There are indeed faster and, sadly, significantly more furious movies in the Fast & Furious canon.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
fresh	Huisman is charming, but it's Ford who makes this movie. Ford's been involved with so many action movies, it's easy to forget his acting talent.
fresh	Age Of Adaline rewards viewers who buy into its ludicrous premise with a frequently beautiful, occasionally stirring cinematic trinket.
rotten	The makings of an interesting movie are here, but the script, written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz, collapses on itself in the third act.
fresh	It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points. A rumination on loneliness.
fresh	Lovers of the genre will find plenty to love about the stylish Age of Adaline and may find themselves rooting through pockets for a tissue at points, a romance movie equivalent of a standing ovation.
rotten	The story itself is hardly epic and certainly isn't romantic, which makes us focus on how ludicrous the whole thing is.
rotten	Starved of sufficient comedy or drama, "The Age of Adaline" is a pipsqueak.
fresh	A surprisingly effective fable. Blake Lively is excellent.
rotten	A preposterous premise treated with great solemnity. Lively shines, though, as does Ford.
fresh	Plausibility, shmausibility. This is pretty schmaltz done right.
rotten	Someone should steal this concept and make a decent movie out of it.
rotten	"The Age of Adaline" works best as a simple story of boy meets girl; girl falls in love; girl mulls whether or not to reveal that she'll stay young forever. Everything else is just a lot of unnecessary noise.
rotten	As awkward love triangles go, this is second only to the 1989 film Chances Are, where Robert Downey Jr. discovers that in a past life, he was his girlfriend's father. (Gross.)
rotten	A middling romance intended as counter-programming before a summer of world-savers and life-takers, The Age of Adaline is an adequate way to kill a few mortal hours in the theater for romance fans.
fresh	"Adaline" Enchants Despite Lack of Chemistry
rotten	Manages to score some select moments of goodwill, but ultimately hampers itself with a severely underdeveloped story.
rotten	The story's magic realism is so torpid and affected as to make the film feel as if it, like Adaline herself, goes on forever.
fresh	Ultimately, you believe Lively as an old soul in a young body, carrying a heavy secret; you hope, somehow, that love will bring her a happy ending.
rotten	Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove, like someone just asked to kiss her hand. It might be the most sepia-toned performance I've ever seen.
fresh	This YA-style romantic fantasy could have been cringe-inducing; instead it's a serviceable fable about the importance of mortality.
rotten	For a movie that emulates literature, The Age Of Adaline never fits comfortably into a particular form-literary or cinematic.
rotten	Aims to be as timeless as its main character, but it ends up feeling like a musty relic.
rotten	If Estee Lauder made a movie, it might look a lot like The Age Of Adaline, a swooning, fawning romance about a woman who achieves what no anti-wrinkle cream has before.
fresh	A low-stakes, high-concept romance, gifted with warm cinematography and lush period trappings.
fresh	"The Age of Adaline" weaves a fantastical tale within a plausible real-world setting. Blake Lively gives a performance of remarkable depth and sensitivity.
fresh	Shameless but mostly well-executed date-night fare, but Blake Lively seems like the wrong fit for the lead.
rotten	Lively's performance is appropriately mysterious but too shallow to allow audiences to empathize with her character. The fault lies more in the screenplay, which doesn't give her character much depth.
fresh	Beautiful but shallow, but also beautiful - a spell that only breaks once you turn on your brain, which you shouldn't anyway.
fresh	Adaline is consistently gorgeous to look at-and a good reminder that love, even when it's complicated or painful or doesn't last, is a whole lot better than immortality.
fresh	Age of Adaline - while frequently preposterous - has just enough pixie dust that it ought to find a fan base among romantic types.
rotten	Less a sincerely kooky elegy to lost time than a slightly off-kilter acting out of familiar rom-com bona fides about commitment-phobes missing out on life.
fresh	Sad, wistfully romantic and featuring maybe the best performance Harrison Ford has ever given on the big screen.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a pearl of a film: intimate despite its century long scale, new and old at once, it's a small movie to discover and carry with you.
fresh	Lively is an odd screen presence - somehow both warm and cold, accessible and recessive. She's long been ripe for a breakthrough lead role that allows her to stretch and surprise.
rotten	Lively's never been better, but "Adaline" is more interested in what she's wearing than what her character's thinking.
fresh	Blake Lively's subtle, expressive performance sets the tone for this thoroughly ludicrous, thoroughly enjoyable romantic drama.
rotten	Director Lee Toland Krieger hits all the expected emotional beats but doesn't take many risks or glean sufficient insights about our fascination with the double-edged sword of eternal youth.
fresh	In what is likely to be the year's most deliriously satisfying illustration of what happens when you feed a chick flick steroids, Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) hits emotional paydirt as a turn-of-the-20th-century gal who stops ageing at 29.
fresh	Stay far away if romantic movies bother you. For everyone else, this very much delivers on its earnest intentions.
rotten	It floats, like Lively herself, in a kind of timeless bubble.
fresh	Indie darling Lee Toland Krieger has managed to pull off this high concept film with an innocent charm that harks back to Golden Age Hollywood romance.
fresh	Harrison Ford emerges as Krieger's trump card...It is a raw, vulnerable performance that ensures the film soars and draws fresh reserves out of Lively (the definition of 'Supporting Actor', surely).
fresh	Never mind that the story is far fetched, the film engages largely due to a winning central performance by Blake Lively as the ageless Adaline, who spends her life running instead of living because she fears someone will learn her secret
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
rotten	Lazy gags, and it's been done better elsewhere.
fresh	This kiddie sci-fi adaptation doesn't quite live up to its evocative title.
fresh	I brought a couple of my kids, who liked it fine and found the friendship at the center rather affecting.
rotten	The feature doesn't connect in a significant way, reduced to a series of skits, poo-poo, pee-pee jokes, and commercials for the soundtrack.
fresh	Oh and Tip may not be the most memorable animated duo, but Parsons's high-pitched squeal and the groove in Rihanna's voice bounce off each other nicely.
rotten	While watching "Home," a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
fresh	You could do a lot better in the kid-film arena than this, but you could also do a Smek of a lot worse.
rotten	DreamWorks movies are often about outsiders learning that they don't have to fit in, a lesson the filmmakers may not have absorbed themselves.
rotten	Only mildly annoying.
rotten	The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.
rotten	Like the timorous Boov, "Home" has little interest in risk-taking.
rotten	Home cunningly attempts to achieve that always-expected animated feat of being everything to everyone, but what it really proves -- with more authenticity than the content itself can muster -- is just how infrequently that can be done.
rotten	Racial diversity and girl power are dandy, but they cannot compensate for uninspired material.
fresh	Aimed squarely at eight-and-unders.
fresh	As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm.
fresh	Home doesn't sparkle enough to make the transition from kids film to modern classic... That said, Home is possibly the most cheerful alien-invasion-of-Earth film you're likely to see.
rotten	An earnest exercise that falls flat, despite the best of intentions.
fresh	"Home" is a solid double in a time when DreamWorks really needs a home run.
rotten	Home marks a throwback to the hyperactive, pop culture-fixated DreamWorks of old, where star power alone pushes straight-to-VOD material into theatres
rotten	Home's exposition is a mess of forced zaniness, which leaves the rest of the film with a Swiss-cheese foundation.
rotten	Steve Martin has fun as the pompous Captain Smek, but this remains little more than colourfully inoffensive.
fresh	Home has an original, convincingly satirical concept at its heart, but much of the execution feels overly familiar.
rotten	It's good, clean, harmless fun.
fresh	A pastel-coloured visual delight with an emphasis on soft-edges and bubbles, director Tim Johnson (Antz; Over the Hedge) aims the film squarely at kids who won't mind the regular overdoses of touchy-feely cheese.
rotten	...more than likely going into the DreamWorks pile of films you won't remember in five years time.
fresh	ET meets Lilo & Stitch in this sweet, screwball culture clash comedy adapted from Adam Rex's children's novel The True Meaning of Smekday.
rotten	This bowls along amiably enough, boosted by some astonishing visuals, but is let down by a gossamer-thin script and uninspired characters.
rotten	Home is schematic and moralistic in the frequent manner of modern American cartoons, although the moralising doesn't entirely make sense: there are a couple of underlying metaphors that don't quite mesh.
fresh	The film combines wit with mind-boggling inanity but is so brash and good-natured that it is very hard to dislike.
rotten	The film takes the lazy route of cannibalising pop cultural references rather than coming up with decent jokes.
fresh	An entertaining odd-couple comedy on very traditional lines ...
rotten	Animation has become a crowded field, and perhaps we shouldn't always expect something out of this world, but this underdeveloped offering barely lifts itself off the drawing board. It's very, very...oh.
rotten	Mostly harmless.
rotten	Home does very little to be interesting or original.
fresh	A sharp script and especially colourful imagery make this animated romp a lot more fun than expected, entertaining grown-ups just as much as the kids...
fresh	Science fiction with training wheels, fine for sucking the kiddies into geekery but with little appeal for grownup fans of animated genre adventure.
rotten	Inoffensive but flavourless, and crammed with familiar elements from better movies like  Lilo and Stitch ,  Toy Story  and  Despicable Me .
rotten	Home's infantilism is a regressive step for DreamWorks, offering a sour rather than sweet experience for audiences.
fresh	Adapted from Adam Rex's novel in praise of family and friends, Antz director Tim Johnson's film is original and fresh, with an easy to understand narrative that finds its endearing protagonist Oh on a journey that takes him from zero to hero
rotten	There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like Home, an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar.
fresh	The story has a pleasant warmth to it - together with a vague message about individuality and tolerance - and Parsons does a terrific job bringing the charmingly open-hearted Oh to life.
rotten	From a creative standpoint, this is the studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Dragon."
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
fresh	[Blaire's] atrocious spelling and grammar will no doubt annoy purists, but speaks to how srsly stressed she is. And something as simple as a pointer hesitating or pacing between two windows provides its own window into her motivation.
fresh	As a harangue about cyberbullying, it's purely exploitative, but when "Unfriended" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives? It's srsly fun, imo.
rotten	A horror pic with a new gimmick that likely will spawn an entire subgenre of more substandard rubbish.
rotten	At times, "Unfriended" really clicks - but ultimately, it's a drag.
fresh	The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. It's supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest, but the movie is speaking the right language.
rotten	You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.
rotten	It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting, claustrophobic physical setting.
fresh	The best thing about "Unfriended," beyond its funny-nasty title, is that it doesn't play as remotely dull as it sounds even if most of the drama takes place inside shifting, overlapping windows.
fresh	Younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the film's underlying message ...
rotten	Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
rotten	Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no one's tried an idea before doesn't mean it's a great one.
fresh	A movie to be seen, if you can endure it-as a shrewd commercial venture, as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and, last and foremost, as a window on a mode of thinking that equates to a state of being.
rotten	The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable, yet unmotivated, character turns. There's no one to root for, not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough.
fresh	Fresh and fearsome fun.
rotten	I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood, or some sort of natural disaster. Aren't the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time?
rotten	One of the rare occasions where an aesthetic decision drives the experience... It lacks in the legitimate fear department, however.
fresh	Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015.
rotten	Unfriended should be applauded for addressing a very serious issue in today's culture of anonymity-driven public shaming, but the fact that it's surrounded by so much stupidity weakens its message.
fresh	It's a mean, potent little movie.
fresh	It looks just beneath the surface of today's technology and discovers a place crawling with terrors all its own.
fresh	The filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick, turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process, they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.
fresh	It's interesting to wonder how the film will age, given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem, technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.
fresh	Though not particularly ground-breaking-last year's Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick, and much more ambitiously-we're still going to "like" the result.
rotten	Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze, "Unfriended" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along.
fresh	It's basically Friday the 13th on a laptop, but the gimmick works like gangbusters. One request: Please Hollywood cybergods, no sequels.
fresh	It will be interesting after Unfriended ends its theatrical run and it can be viewed on a home computer. That will create the unsettling situation where the viewer is almost a new participant in this online game of supernatural cyberstalking.
fresh	It will surely cut close to the bone for many, as all the best horror movies do.
fresh	This isn't great cinema, folks. It's more of a novelty. But it's a cleverly constructed novelty.
fresh	"Unfriended" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But it's clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then ...
rotten	Unfriended proves that you absolutely can make a movie that unfolds entirely on a computer. The question it doesn't answer is why you'd want to.
fresh	Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 you'll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when, even if you're not a cyberbullying white teen.
fresh	We need these teens to click clearly diseased links and bicker with one another while a ghost eggs them on. It's ridiculous, but when executed this competently, the absurd becomes riveting.
fresh	A great gimmick, but uncinematic and not as scary as you'd hope.
fresh	Neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its "Titus Andronicus"-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises, it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can.
fresh	It hates millenials so much it could have been made by Ben Stiller's documentarian in 'While We're Young.'
fresh	...a modern take on Scream for the Skype generation.
fresh	While it's not a flawless fright flick, Unfriended gives us a good gimmick as byte-sized horror that's easy to 'like' before moving onto the next distraction.
fresh	Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre.
fresh	Simultaneously clever and exasperating.
fresh	This is a movie for savvy Internet kids, and it feels savvy itself. Unlike so many other movies that make this attempt and feel ancient, [Unfriended] feels current.
rotten	In the end one would rather be back at one's own computer, tending to the tedious details of digital life, than watching this clique get pinged to death.
fresh	A clever spin on the found footage genre, and a tight little horror flick that's good for a solid scare or two.
fresh	Writer Nelson Greaves and director Levan Gabriadze do a decent job of creating genuine tension within the almost theatrical, proscenium-like arrangement of the computer screen.
fresh	When the genre-film spectacle arrives, it's in full force, and the strictures of the framing device manage to amplify, rather than suppress, the impact of the shocks and scares.
rotten	"Unfriended" is diverting and energetic and should be awarded points for attempting to be the Facebook generation's "Ringu," but it fails to create memorable characters and is awash in tired cliches and muddy mythology.
fresh	None of the slasher stuff is anywhere near as disturbing as the routine cruelty of the actual internet.
fresh	It's a gimmick movie, and like most gimmick movies [it] sometimes bends over backwards to make it work. But like the best gimmick movies the conceit never gets boring, and it actually has something pointed to say.
fresh	Unfriended is a terrifying cyber nightmare for today's generation of laptop-loving teenagers who think trolls are the worst thing the internet has to offer.
fresh	Unfriended is a smart, thrilling, and addicting byte of horror that's worth thinking about. It'll be awhile before your mind hits CTRL + ALT + DEL on this one
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	Delivers a slick, serviceable blend of romance and melodrama. Your typical love and sacrifice and bull-riding tale.
rotten	There's little here to convince the audience of boy and girl's special chemistry, and nothing to attach the audience to them, either.
fresh	Everything is tied up in a neat moral bow, with Luke realising that the challenge of the rodeo pales next to the "longest ride" of the title, which -- I hope I'm not giving too much away -- is the ride they call life.
fresh	Though Tillman doesn't quite elevate the maudlin material into serious drama, the result is uncommonly sensitive.
rotten	Sparks' perverse need for love to be perfect-even if it takes cancer to make it happen-becomes The Longest Ride's undoing.
fresh	This is spoon-fed entertainment, but it tastes pretty good.
rotten	Even when Eastwood and Robertson, pleasant enough company, threaten to float off the screen, "The Longest Ride" glides along and delivers its reheated comfort food by the ton.
rotten	Everything in the movie is suffused by a vision of life that is resoundingly and evidently false, but as this vision is not repulsive, but is intended to reassure, the lies don't produce anger or frustration. No, they bring on the laughs.
rotten	The two-plus hours is mostly marked by an emptiness born of scene after scene designed to blatantly manipulate emotions rather than trigger them.
rotten	The Longest Ride is sentimental, forced and silly, but it's sure to hit the bull's-eye with its intended audience.
rotten	As sexy as a rodeo clown and much slower.
rotten	Fairly tedious, despite the charm and sincerity of the actors.
rotten	There's little doubt where Cormac McCarthy-bashing Sparks's allegiances lie. The Longest Ride is truly no country for old ambiguity.
rotten	A weepie that smashes together the Holocaust, bull-riding and Alan Alda, and yet still doesn't achieve cheesy transcendency.
rotten	Insipid
rotten	Qualifies as one of the best Sparks films by virtue of not including any love-ghosts or destructive misinformation about how Alzheimer's works.
fresh	Carolina settings, star-crossed lovers, elements of tragedy: Sparks' formula works. Get out your handkerchiefs, and rest assured that there will be uplift at the end.
fresh	It's easy to tease a Nicholas Sparks movie. It's harder to admit that he's good at his niche - and has a string of 10 films, nearly all profitable, to prove it
fresh	A well-told love story that starts a little formulaic but quickly turns into something that's enjoyable to watch unfold.
fresh	[Nicholas Sparks'] stories can provoke any one of us, curmudgeon or no, to shed a tear or two over the impossible dream of living in one of his fairytale universes.
fresh	The film is likely to satisfy Sparks fans. And it brings something new to the romance genre: bull riding.
rotten	This predictably sudsy screen adaptation unabashedly oozes slush and sentimentality....
rotten	It's dumb, it's long, it's dull, but it isn't quite bad enough to be camp.
rotten	Appealing performances by a trio of second- and third-generation Hollywood kids keep this three-hankie twaddle more bearable than it deserves, but "Ride" will surely go the longest with audiences for whom this is not their first Sparks rodeo.
rotten	An undistinguished romantic drama that takes few risks and offers wish-fulfilling escapism with bland dutifulness.
rotten	Just as the basic plot points are hard to swallow, even the most rudimentary aspects of the characters' interactions feel forced, artificial and unspontaneous.
fresh	Delivers romance, passion, heartbreak and surprises - beautifully. The film is an ideal chick flick, date movie and emotional tour de force for anyone who is a romantic at heart
rotten	The real love story is between Eastwood and David Tattersall's camera, which spends so much time leering over the actor's cheekbones, abs and other attributes that you begin to wonder if someone's going to call Human Resources.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
rotten	Not entirely unfunny.
fresh	Your standard Ferrell/Hart vehicle that's rarely witty enough to live up to its potential, but still delivers enough laughs for those seeking a silly comedy.
rotten	The highest praise I can give "Get Hard" is that it is not quite as awful as it could have been.
rotten	A lazy attempt to drag out a Funny or Die-style skit to feature length by continuously recycling about eight minutes worth of gags.
rotten	Expect over-the-top idiocy. Expect graphic sexual gags. Expect a lesson on the prison art of 'keistering.' And, yes, expect lots of dicey racial humor.
rotten	Will Ferrell has built his film career on being an everyman or a naif devoid of self-consciousness. In Etan Cohen's Get Hard, Ferrell goes with the latter, but adds a patina of ultra-rich entitlement.
fresh	The movie seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts.
fresh	Silly, offensive but effective.
rotten	Weighed down by endless jokes about prison rape, relentless homophobia and a bevy of absurd stereotypes, this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart film sinks into an abyss of failure.
rotten	The distasteful, often flat Get Hard succeeds only as a testament to the resilience of talent.
rotten	With Ferrell and Hart involved, it's probably impossible for anyone to completely resist their baser instincts to be amused by the patently offensive. Though it's hard not to wish more moviegoers would.
fresh	It's still ultimately a disposable work, but at least while it's going, it hits hard.
fresh	It's tricky territory to tread, and Get Hard doesn't always get it right, but in a nation where racial and economic divides are growing issues, it deserves credit for trying.
fresh	The high concept is delivered more or less efficiently: basically an incorrect and funnier version of Spike Lee's 25th Hour, with a dash of Trading Places.
rotten	The oft-repeated gags about prison rape and the frequent racial stereotypes become such a drag that solitary confinement might be a welcome break.
rotten	A movie that refuses to recognize when it's going too far, with its wince-eliciting jokes about jailhouse rape in particular.
rotten	A movie you're waiting to finish rather than anticipating the finale.
rotten	If you don't think the over-rehearsed prospect of prison rape - specifically, black-on-white prison rape - is quite enough of a comedy goldmine to sustain a whole feature, tell that to the screenwriters.
fresh	Will Ferrell is looking at ten years in the slammer in a comedy that delivers a hard slap in the face to political correctness.
fresh	If Get Hard isn't quite the biting satire that its premise would imply - though it's more unabashedly eat-the-rich than some critics have given it credit for - it's consistently ridiculous enough to be funny more often than not.
fresh	Pairing Ferrell's looming, kooky calm with Hart's pint-sized, pugnacious bluster proves a complimentary meshing, rising star Hart's incredulous observer an audience stand-in for Ferrell's boor-out-of-water style comedy.
rotten	The movie overcompensates for its lack of cleverness with an oversimplified story and an enormous amount of lowbrow humor.
rotten	Funny bits come along every now and then, and the co-stars work desperately hard for their salaries. But the spectacle is depressing for what it says of mainstream studio standards.
rotten	Here is an ounce of credit to Get Hard for avoiding any mention of the innuendo involving an inmate dropping the soap in the prison shower.
rotten	Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence.
rotten	Get Hard is just smart enough and funny enough to make you realize that with a little actual effort it might have been much more funny. But why bother writing jokes or a plot when it's easier to talk about how much anal rape goes on in prison?
rotten	'Get Hard' might be the perfect flick to show at your next frat party at the University of Oklahoma.
rotten	All the comedic and visual elan of an amateur YouTube fratboy prank, include nonstop rape jokes and rampant homophobia. Are you laughing yet?
rotten	A movie which light-heartedly treads around ideas of corruption, race relations and corporate greed, Get Hard somehow manages to fall flat at almost every corner.
rotten	My complaint isn't that the film is "racist"- it's that it doesn't use that sort of material to do anything particularly original or funny.
rotten	Anal rape jokes and racial stereotypes dominate this third-rate comedy.
rotten	Leaves a gap that should be filled with gags.
fresh	Get Hard is stupid, raunchy and offensive -- but that's what it's going for.
rotten	The whole film is a nonstop parade of dick jokes, rape jokes, and Will Ferrell making the same goofy faces he first introduced on SNL ages ago.
fresh	Get Hard manages to be funny enough to both recommend and to laugh at out loud without feeling public embarrassment.
rotten	Get Hard is hard to sit through and hardly funny.
rotten	The germ of an interesting idea in Get Hard is completely overshadowed by the onslaught of jokes meant to be boundary-pushing and edgy.
fresh	Subtly, not in a way anyone would notice without looking for it, the movie switches back and forth, giving each comedian a chance to be the funny one and the other to lend support.
fresh	Ideally, this would be Blazing Saddles for folks who chug kombucha. Yet it's harder to satirize race today than it was 40 years ago - more sensitive times impose gentler jokes.
rotten	The film's numbing lack of intelligence, exhibited from the start, makes "Get Hard" tough to watch, even by Hart/Ferrell standards.
rotten	In a parallel world, there is a version of this movie that is just as offensive, but also funny and smart. It's a pity we will never see it.
rotten	Tries hard to turn Ferrell/Hart into Wilder/Pryor but fails miserably.
rotten	by the final act, the entire fish-out-of-water concept is scrapped as Hart and Ferrell play bumbling cops and robbers and attempt to solve a crime. Haven't we been punished enough?
rotten	Descends so far into racial stereotyping, offhanded homophobia, class division, sexual coarseness and scatological gags that whatever chemistry the stars might have brought to the table is pretty much dissipated.
fresh	Hart and Ferrell may not be Pryor and Wilder, but they score several laughs in this slim comedy.
rotten	Get Hard is a movie that wants to be perverse so bad ... but the delicate line necessary has scribble marks all over it. Get Hard is sad scribble.
rotten	It's like a chocolate wrapped in poop and then dipped in more chocolate. There's no way to enjoy it without tasting some crap.
rotten	it requires an awful lot of dense conceptual thinking to see Get Hard as a genuine satire of race, and not an exercise in old-fashioned stereotype-based comedy.
rotten	This is a horrible idea for a movie. It is, however, a decent idea for an extended sketch, and that's how the first two-thirds of the movie plays.
rotten	The dubious merit of tiresome "don't drop the soap" jokes aside, "Get Hard" sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.
rotten	I laughed when Ferrell smashed a bottle of beer on the sidewalk, just to show he's tough, but if that's a movie's standout bit, that movie's no standout.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart join forces for a fitfully amusing but problematically conceived modern-day version of Trading Places.
rotten	I wish the on-point shots taken at the so-called investor class weren't just a prelude to a rather generic, weak-willed, and vulgar farce.
rotten	Get Hard is one limp noodle.
rotten	It's hard to believe the man who co-wrote "Tropic Thunder" and "Idiocracy" could be responsible for a movie this dreadful.
rotten	Getting huge laughs somewhere from Beavis and Butt-Head or their real-life equivalents.
rotten	"Get Hard" is not challenging its audience; it's pandering to it and trying to get away with weak material.
rotten	Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.
rotten	Get Hard tries for easy laughs over intelligent commentary, but it doesn't succeed at either one.
rotten	"Get Hard" wants to be a brash, unapologetic look at race and class but only wrings a few laughs from those topics, mostly spending its time floundering around in a dumb plot.
rotten	Somewhere amid the unbearable stereotypes that choke this sophomoric comedy is a potent blue-collar revenge fantasy about an arrogant white-collar crook getting his just comeuppance.
fresh	Only the humorless will frown at Ferrell's easy way with white-guy entitlement. "I'm going to be attending San Quentin," the Harvard grad sniffs, almost as a point of pride; later, after tasting thug life, he calls it an "ambrosia of primal sensations."
rotten	Get Hard is not only a bad movie but a profoundly wasted opportunity.
rotten	It's still a dumb movie, but the kind of dumb movie that, by bravely (or stupidly) strutting its way into prickly social discussions accidentally makes cogent points about same. Sometimes.
fresh	For some reason this movie offended a lot of critic-types at SXSW but the only thing that would really be offensive here is if it wasn't funny. And thanks to a nice teaming of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart this is surprisingly funny stuff.
fresh	Racist, and more than a little homophobic. But also frequently funny, until it gets really silly trying to follow a plot.
rotten	"Get Hard" isn't edgy enough to be offensive or witty enough to be challenging. It's just dumb.
fresh	In this occasionally brilliant, if somewhat uneven, showcase of speedy plotting and even speedier improvisation, Hart and Ferrell's chemistry is such that it seems certain to pair them up in the future.
fresh	Ferrell and Hart work well together: both are highly verbal performers, supported by a script full of unlikely linguistic flourishes.
rotten	For a movie whose premise depends on the mockery of someone who offensively stereotypes (Ferrell's character assumes that Hart's has been to prison), it deals heavily in stereotypes itself, wanting its cake and eating it too.
rotten	It already seems more dated than Trading Places - not to mention less savvy about all the subjects it pretends to be addressing while it tries to make us laugh.
fresh	Laughter trumps political fairness; and Get Hard made me laugh at, and with, situations I hadn't thought could tickle me. The movie has a warm heart beating under its seemingly scabrous shell.
rotten	If you're disturbed by white-collar crime, but not quite as disturbed as you are by gay sex, then congratulations: You might possess just the right combo of social conscience and unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy Get Hard.
fresh	There's a daring comedy somewhere inside writer Etan Cohen's directorial debut, which simultaneously trivializes and solemnizes the prospect of prison rape.
fresh	"Get Hard" is worth a look for fans of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. And the two do work well together. But anyone with a low tolerance for politically incorrect stereotyping and lowbrow humor should sit this one out.
rotten	Get Hard isn't terrible. It's funny often enough to stave off impatience. That's something, I guess.
rotten	Kevin Hart shoehorned into a standard issue Will Ferrell character comedy
fresh	Offensive by design and low-brow by nature, the joke wears thin by the end, but the film's saving grace is its raw energy; a feeling that anything goes, as the narrative leapfrogs from one unlikely bad-taste scenario to the next
fresh	An inspired pairing of the relentlessly absurd Ferrell and the motor-mouthed Hart at the top of their games.
fresh	It's stupid and immature, but I mean that as a compliment. Stupid and immature is funny.
rotten	The greatest comedic geniuses of our time or any other couldn't improve on a script as basically, fundamentally wrong as GET HARD's.
rotten	"Get Hard" is an absolutely horrible, amateurishly assembled comedy that is more offensive than just about anything we've seen lately.
rotten	Finally, a comedy that homophobes, racists and generally stupid people can all enjoy together!
rotten	Unfortunately, Hart and Ferrell just couldn't get hard enough for me.
rotten	Get Hard quickly descends from an off-putting comedy of opposites to the kind of movie that time and the changing styles of comedy in the modern age will turn into a relic sooner rather than later.
rotten	Hey, did you know that in prison, there is a lot of RAPE?
rotten	The script, by TV comedy writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, doesn't give the stars much to work with and their apparent improvisation is only fleetingly effective.
fresh	Written down, this sounds horrendous; watching it, I have to admit that I laughed ...
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
rotten	Premise grabs, but more like excruciating eventually. I, Nobot.
rotten	It's the predictability that ultimately hurts "Ex Machina". Talk about killing the suspense ---
fresh	We can extract at least one truism from this imaginative and beguiling story. Women hate to be treated as chattel --- even if they're robots.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues.
fresh	A beautifully-crafted science fiction drama that recalls the ingenuity and brilliance of "Jurassic Park."
fresh	It may not be a modern masterpiece of sci-fi, but it's close enough to pass for one.
fresh	Visually stunning, intellectually provocative, emotionally powerful.
rotten	The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
fresh	"Ex Machina" isn't quite "Citizen Kane" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea.
fresh	Garland also seduces with clean frames, sleek, elegant surfaces, and the most physically convincing of robots on screen in memory. Sentience is sexy!
fresh	A singularly chilling cinematic stunner that coexists as a wild daydream and a prescient glimpse into the future.
fresh	A rattling and ruminative piece of speculative fiction, Ex Machina is good enough to wish it were even better.
fresh	Its aura of cool menace is largely attributable to Isaac, stealing his every scene as the smoothly bullying CEO, and production designer Mark Digby, who created the millionaire's sleek, high-tech mountain fortress.
fresh	Ex Machina addresses heady issues of A.I., exploring what it means to be human or, more important, what it means to be an imitation of humanity so real, what's the actual difference?
fresh	A coolly cerebral sci-fi tale that really isn't all that inventive but nonetheless casts quie a spell.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a smart, exceptionally stylish head trip.
fresh	Garland sidles up to some large ideas, some more provocative than others, and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual, omnivorous surveillance.
fresh	It's hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes.
fresh	Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina, a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence, consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story, dialogue and character.
fresh	Merciless, efficient and terrifyingly logical...
fresh	Ex Machina is intelligent science fiction operating at a very high level.
fresh	It will make you look at every other movie about artificial intelligence in a whole new way.
rotten	More tricky than smart.
fresh	In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate.
fresh	Garland more than establishes himself as talent to watch. The perfect balance between the cerebral and the emotional, crafting a thrilling film that still remains intellectually provocative - A difficult creature to build indeed.
fresh	The best thing about "Ex Machina" is the robotic depiction of Ava, a sleek humanoid that exudes sex appeal.
fresh	Slow paced, but thought provoking science fiction.
fresh	A thrilling work of sci-fi ... a smart and visually alluring film that contemplates chilling questions about where technology is headed and the consequences of playing God.
fresh	Beautifully haunting.
fresh	With Ex Machina writer/director Alex Garfield delivers a science fiction film full of concepts and ideas versus overblown visual effects.
fresh	Like Ava herself, Garland manipulates our sympathies, rendering his climax all the more horrifying and his denouement, albeit understated, terrifying.
fresh	This is the best, most credible, of the artificial intelligence movies to date. Garland keeps the tension up and the pace moving by tackling many thought-provoking existential issues. I was pleasantly surprised, rewarded, by what I had just seen.
rotten	The writer and director, Alex Garland, keeps the movie so full of doomy atmosphere that expecting the worst sort of becomes a treat. But gradually the hypnosis wears off, the mystique dissipates, and banalities take over.
fresh	Many movies...almost require a reverse Turing test - you can't quite believe they were written by humans, rather than number-crunching machines. I'm happy to say Ex Machina would pass.
fresh	A chilly yet engrossing drama, elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garland's screenplay.
fresh	Ex Machina achieves that rare combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings, and it deserves to be known as a sci-fi classic.
fresh	A TED Talk in the form of a movie, with a few creepy twists and suspenseful deceptions that keep the plot moving forward.
fresh	[O]ne of the finest sci-fi productions of the decade... as intellectually compelling as it is emotionally provocative.
fresh	Gleeson is terrific and Vikander, who stars in five other films this year alone, is a revelation. As is Ex Machina, a movie that looks like something destined to be savored, watched and re-watched endlessly over the years.
fresh	We will be very lucky if we get another movie either as good or better this year.
fresh	...doesn't hold a candle to Spike Jonze's "Her" for insights into man's relationship with artificial intelligence. For all its stunning locations, brilliant design and seamless visual effects, the story begs the question 'Is that all there is?'
fresh	A small sci-fi classic...
fresh	Although "Ex Machina" is small and talky - it has just four characters, and the only action comes at the end - it also looks good. The set direction is interesting and evocative. The effects impress but don't overwhelm.
fresh	Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made, "Ex Machina" is a spooky piece of speculative fiction that's completely plausible, capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills.
fresh	While Mr. Garland wants to tease your brain, he's an entertainer, and in time ditches science and philosophy for romance and action.
fresh	turns a standard story into something quite special
rotten	Reasonably diverting until its predictable (and predictably misogynistic) outcome.
fresh	It's become far too commonplace to overuse the term 'masterpiece,' but Alex Garland's directorial debut comes about as close as you can get.
fresh	I know, I know. You've seen all this A.I. stuff before. But never like this. Garland is hot for ethical shop talk on what defines humanity or lack of same.
fresh	Sizzlingly smart and agreeably sententious, Mr. Garland's film transcends some all-too-human imperfections with gorgeous images, astute writing and memorably strong performances.
fresh	This is a classic film.
fresh	If any film needed a brief, impromptu hip hop dance scene (Oscar Isaac, predictably, has moves), it's one attempting a treatise on the meaning of existence.
fresh	It makes up for its linearity with verve, first in the impeccably controlled, intellectually rigorous direction, and then in the performances.
fresh	The year's most seductive high-IQ drama.
fresh	Ex Machina is beautiful and ominous and features another delicately nuanced performance from Isaac, who's quickly making a habit of them. But in the end, for all of Garland's ambition, his reach winds up exceeding his grasp.
rotten	Clever novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland makes a half-dandy directorial debut with Ex Machina, a sci-fi film that - like much of his work - fakes excitingly in the direction of breaking new ground before turning formulaic so fast.
fresh	Austere, cerebral and chilling
fresh	For a first-time director, Garland seems assured. His sharp, sparse dialogue and meticulous direction are equally compelling, and the trio of lead performances are top-notch.
fresh	Make no mistake, this is a film of ideas-sadder, quieter, more delicate than the Hollywood sci-fi standard-where every sliding wall of opaque glass suggests something about technology and the way people would use it.
fresh	It's the film version of an iPhone: small, expensive-looking and a touch overhyped - plus an addictive sales pitch for whatever Garland makes next.
fresh	It doesn't quite add up in the end, but it's heady stuff anyway, dense with moments of shivery beauty and frightening ideas.
fresh	An intriguing four-character sci-fi drama about explorers of artificial intelligence.
fresh	"Ex Machina" shows there's still life left in tales of artificial intelligence.
fresh	By going deep on a simple construct, Ex Machina establishes itself as a unique and deeply unsettling psychological thriller that's both necessary and unforgettable.
fresh	With uncommon intelligence and the even more uncommon ability to look without blinking, Garland's made the one of the best sci-fi films of the past several years, a wicked and wise parable of the near-now that's honed to a gleam.
fresh	Smart, sexy, and back-loaded with a terrific twist ending, "Ex Machina" is an elegant sci-fi movie that considers the possibilities of artificial intelligence in thought-provoking ways.
fresh	Wickedly smart and often wickedly funny, this delightfully entertaining science fiction drama is one of the best films of the year.
fresh	'Ex Machina' is a very cool science-fiction movie.
rotten	Beautifully crafted, but empty at its core.
fresh	"Ex Machina," despite the stutters, slowly finds its grip and starts to squeeze.
fresh	A sleek, good-looking meditation on the nature of artificial intelligence, on what happens when we create robots that can pass for human.
fresh	Ex Machina is what I call an existential horror movie. It feels as visceral as anything created by the Crichtons, Spielbergs, and Scotts of an era gone by, but it's got a contemporary, current, and forward-thinking propulsion to it.
rotten	The real question may be: can our philosophies about artificial intelligence evolve with our stories?
fresh	Might not be the first film about the dangers inherent in giving robots free will, but it's certainly one of the most accomplished.
rotten	There comes a point where, if we have been paying attention, we know what will happen once a character walks out a door.
rotten	In the end, more than just the machine remains an enigma.
fresh	It's a very smart movie and seems to almost be cognitive of what the audience is thinking ... one of the best pure sci-fi movies to come out in a very long time.
fresh	...[Ex Machina] never stops being slick, cool, and polished, its intelligence not artificial at all.
fresh	A confident, engrossing debut.
fresh	Like the artificial intelligence at its center, EX MACHINA is an experience that is both cerebral and sensual. It's riveting. It has secrets. And it will certainly surprise you.
fresh	It's a place where man's social retardation and his sexual fantasies collide.
fresh	Compelling, claustrophobic, cutting edge and clever, Ex Machina is as smart and satisfying as science fiction gets.
fresh	An intriguingly stripped-down sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence that's fully attuned to its more blockbuster elements yet pleasingly cerebral at the same time.
fresh	The film touches an exposed nerve: the nagging fear that sometime in the not-too-distant future computers will outstrip and outsmart their creators.
fresh	This is knowingly seductive sci-fi cinema, its slyly subversive allegiances hidden by the two-way mirror of the silver screen, its androids dreaming of much more than mere electric sheep.
fresh	Closer to Caryl Churchill's stage play A Number than to, say, THX-1138, this tight, tense virtual three- hander sings with creative disharmony.
rotten	There's nothing fresh or even usefully true in its cartoonish dichotomy about men, but this pseudo-SF flick will expound upon it with pretentious tedium.
fresh	Cool! It's a trip! All Alex Garland's creations are a trip.
fresh	Garland has produced something seductively strange, consistently thought-provoking and admirably adult.
fresh	Its thought-provoking themes will gnaw at your own humanity long after the shocking finale has bowed.
fresh	Novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland's first film as a director takes some very old ideas and gives them an ingenious new spin.
rotten	There are sweeping helicopter shots and chic cinematography but this three-hander isn't cinema: it's a Ted talk shot in a boutique hotel, with ideas about consciousness and evolution itemised rather than dramatised.
fresh	Ex Machina is a smart, tricksy study of artificial intelligence and tech-sex that explores a credible near-future take on the man-machine relationship.
fresh	Ex Machina feels like an elegant SF short story with a droll twist that has been pumped up and sexed up into an over-bulky feature film. But it's managed with confidence.
fresh	Smart, swanky, a little inhuman and preternaturally well crafted.
fresh	Slick and seductive, this exploration of artificial intelligence may essentially only have three characters, but it's complex, provocative and thoroughly engaging.
fresh	Stylish, elegant, tense, cerebral, satirical and creepy. Garland's directorial debut is his best work yet, while Vikander's bold performance will short your circuits.
fresh	Feels like a pathway to grander things for Garland.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is one of the headiest and most impressive sci-fi debuts since "Moon," and if we see more than a handful of movies better than it across the next twelve months, 2015 will be a terrific year.
fresh	The lush setting avoids the stifling grey look of so many other sci-fi films and the commendably-restrained special effects are as outstanding as the three fast-rising lead actors.
fresh	This is bewitchingly smart science fiction of a type that's all too rare. Its intelligence is anything but artificial.
fresh	As thoughtful as it is thrilling, Ex Machina is a razor-sharp and nimble character drama which takes a controlled nosedive into exhilarating sci-fi horror.
fresh	There's no little hint of Kubrick and Hitchcockian paranoia to Alex Garland's debut as writer-director, a nifty, quasi-Gothic three-hander of great performances and unerring control.
fresh	A bit more intelligence would not have gone amiss.
fresh	Ex Machina is smart, sexy and thrilling sci-fi filmmaking at its most fascinating.
fresh	There's a lot going on here. But don't think for a second this is troublesome critic-fodder. It's thrilling.
fresh	A smart, accomplished piece of work that presses all the right buttons.
fresh	Gleeson convinces as a desperate-to-please, ambitious young coder. Isaac's difficult-to-read, drunken, pumped-up mad scientist is disquieting and Vikander excels in a demure and shifting role.
fresh	Garland cleverly keeps us on our toes by constantly toying with our allegiances.
fresh	Anchored by three dazzling central performances, it's a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that's essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us.
fresh	Multi-faceted and nuanced, each with so many subtleties and complexities Ex_Machina is a film bursting with ideas.
fresh	For dystopian future-shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws, Garland's feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci-fi.
fresh	A thoughtful and at times unnervingly sly film that makes the very most of the burgeoning star power of Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson.
fresh	Garland's long-anticipated directorial debut synthesizes a dizzy range of the writer's philosophical preoccupations into a sleek, spare chamber piece ...
fresh	Adds a bit of pep to the series' overall mediocrity
rotten	Robert Schwentke's Insurgent is a massively stupid movie.
rotten	There are some thrilling scenes here and there, but mostly, Insurgent is an aggressively familiar experience.
rotten	As far as dystopian young-adult fare goes, 'Insurgent' is average.
fresh	Fresh characters include antipodal substitute mother figures for the newly orphaned Tris -- namely, a huggable agragrian played by Octavia Spencer and a skinny schemer played by Naomi Watts.
rotten	There's not a single frame "wrong" with the movie... but there also isn't anything in the whole of that's even fleetingly entertaining.
fresh	Armed with divergent skills and a freshly self-inflicted, no-fuss hairdo, Tris Prior is feeling Insurgent, and we're down with that. This franchise is one of the more entertaining examples of three popular books stretched to four movies when two would do.
rotten	The Divergent Series: Insurgent is the logical successor to The Hunger Games, in that it features a female lead in a dystopian future America. It would be helpful if The Divergent Series: Insurgent was a good film.
rotten	Miraculously, Woodley escapes from this gargantuan slog unscathed, a feat more exciting than any of the travails of Tris Prior.
fresh	I think the reason critics and audiences are divided by this movie has to do with the main character, Tris. She is a strong female character. An argument can be made that she is a much stronger female character than Katniss is in the Hunger Games series.
rotten	A more efficient indifference generator than its predecessor.
rotten	Large interior scenes seem designed, propped and photographed less like dystopian drama and more like a Broadway musical---I halfway expected someone to break into a song called "Beyond the Wall."
rotten	I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated, totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But there's too much to keep straight.
rotten	Dauntless, Divergent, Erudite, Abnegation, Factionless, Candor. May I add the audience faction, Ennui? If ever a screenplay felt bludgeoned lifeless by a thesaurus, this is it.
rotten	The real problem here lies with the underwritten supporting characters and overabundance of repetitive action sequences.
rotten	There's little substance and little depth, but Woodley, with her preternatural poise, offers a worthy simulation of drama.
fresh	After the tepid snore that was the last "Hunger Games" installment, "Insurgent" is muscular, brisk and imaginative - albeit on an emotive teenage level.
rotten	There's a tad more visual flair and a tad more violence in the second instalment of The Divergent Series, yet Insurgent still looks like an anaemic Hunger Games clone.
fresh	Schwentke cranks up the action enough to keep us distracted, with well-oiled scenes of renegades jumping freight trains, and simulated cliffhangers involving flying fiery buildings offering several edge-of-your-seat moments.
rotten	Insurgent is far too long for the minimal plot it encapsulates, features little in the way of meaningful character development, and is riddled with instances of poorly conceived, contrived developments.
rotten	For a film about standing out, this adaptation of a young adult novel fits its mold too predictably.
rotten	The two-hour effort could benefit from less moping, less violence and especially less fitful dreaming.
rotten	Tris and Four never grow as characters, while Winslet's Jeanine continues to register less as a formidable movie villain and more like that strict teacher you had in 10th grade who always assigned too much homework.
rotten	An angst-riddled, fast-paced sequel - a "Hunger Games" wannabe...
rotten	Woodley is a talented, charismatic actress who deserves a blockbuster franchise. Unfortunately, if Insurgent is any indication, the Divergent movies may not be it.
rotten	The action sequences have been ramped up and Insurgent smartly diverges from the book but it's still such a confusing and uninvolving storyline this YA adaptation made me HUNGER for something more. Thank God for Shailene Woodley though.
rotten	still suffers from the same dumbed-down science fiction storytelling and teen angst reliance that we saw in the first film
rotten	It's all a bit of an unengaging muddle, covered over with concrete grunge, clean white labs, and stagy special effects.
rotten	You won't feel like you wasted your money, but you'll probably think of something better you could have spent it on. Like a "Hunger Games" book.
rotten	Put it this way: At the end of this movie, not one significant character is frozen in carbonite.
rotten	The visuals didn't feel realistic enough to engage and overall "Insurgent" is a let down. Unless you're a hard core fan of the novels upon which it's based, I'd wait for cable.
rotten	Another nonsensical young adult film that makes me root for the evil dystopian society against the plucky heroine.
fresh	Insurgent falls short of hitting the bar set by superior YA film adaptations but is a step in the right direction for the Divergent series.
rotten	The lack of any memorable story elements or overall narrative drive might not be so pronounced if this post-apocalyptic future were even halfway interesting.
fresh	Insurgent is breathlessly paced, well-cast, and thankfully kind of entertaining in its chase film way.
fresh	With the world-building taken care of in part one, "Insurgent" can turn its attention fully to its plot and characters, succeeding more with the former than the latter.
fresh	Insurgent is better than its predecessor and really, for a mildly entertaining action film, Insurgent could have been much worse.
rotten	The dialogue is clunky, and other than Tris the characters are one-dimensional. Moreover, it's all so earnest.
rotten	The final Divergent book will be split into two movies, a future that is indeed a little dystopian. Much brighter, though, are the blossoming careers of Woodley and Teller.
rotten	As a distillation of all that's most ordinary about contemporary young adult science fiction, it could hardly be bettered.
rotten	It was always going to be hard to match the fire-power of The Hunger Games series, but the gap is now huge. If Mockingjay Part 1 resembles a playful, sharp-toothed canine, Insurgent is more like a slug.
rotten	Derivative, dystopian garbage. Teller is the only person to emerge semi-unscathed.
rotten	It's often painful to watch accomplished actors struggle through this material, knowing plainly that they are all here because of the financial opportunities this movie provided, rather than its artistic ones.
rotten	Insurgent is not a very good movie, but it's better than it needs to be.
fresh	As the character embraces her new built-for-action pixie haircut (a holdover from Woodley's role as cancer patient Hazel in "The Fault in Our Stars"), Tris comes into her own as a hero who's both dynamic and sensitive.
fresh	Dystopian sequel ups romance factor; still very violent.
rotten	Ironically teens aren't playing post apocalyptic teen angst trauma characters in this teen angst trauma post apocalyptic, pathetic, practically pointless movie.
fresh	I am not a fan of such stories, usually, but by the end of "Insurgent" I was duly impressed, and interested in the outcome awaiting us in the next film in this series.
rotten	And the thing I find most annoying? Watching these characters maneuver their eyeballs back and forth while gazing into each other's eyes.
rotten	Alas, while the special effects are decently done and the action scenes adequately handled, we don't really care. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	With new screenwriters, new director Robert Schwentke at the helm and a few new players joining the franchise, "Insurgent" is a little better than the first installment, if no less derivative of other dystopian YA series.
rotten	The characters are no further developed by the end of Insurgent than they were at the end of Divergent.
rotten	Insurgent stubbornly fails to surge.
rotten	Woodley's a first-year Girl Scout surrounded by troop leaders, making action scenes stiff and tedious.
rotten	Suffers the usual stuck-in-the-middle problems, and lacks the plot clarity and kinetic thrust that kept the first picture from being a pure "Hunger Games" knockoff.
rotten	"The Divergent Series: Insurgent," the second of four movies, is fresh evidence that "Divergent" is "The Hunger Games" with training wheels.
rotten	It's better than the first one, but I thought the first one kinda stunk, so don't take that statement as too much of a compliment.
rotten	Most of the best stuff is saved for Insurgent's last half-hour, in which the movie goes "lysergic," as on an acid trip.
rotten	Much like the last film, the dialogue and the action suffer from a keen sense of lifelessness.
fresh	Unlike Divergent, which required pages of premise-establishing exposition, Insurgent is more purely action-centric, as the hunters hunt and the hunted flee through the trees, hopping freight trains, trying to elude capture.
fresh	Thankfully there's a lot more action in the latest instalment of the Divergent saga, which is great news because it means fewer slow spots during which you can mull over all the holes in both the story and concept of this hyped up teens-vs-adults dross.
fresh	Compelling in spite of its commonplace premise and themes. Wanting to see where Tris goes from here&#151;and how Shailene Woodley will continue to imbue her with life&#151;is more than enough incentive to keep watching.
rotten	[L]et's be clear: This is only slightly better than the last movie, with 'slightly' being the key.
fresh	At times it's just a weaponized vision of the highly cliquish tables at the high school cafeteria.
rotten	Fans of the source material may still be eager for the next chapter but for casual viewers this is a disappointingly bland sequel.
rotten	The first Divergent instalment proved a bit dull whereas this one is enlivened by some first-rate special effects.
rotten	This second installment, based on Veronica Roth's series of YA novels, feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014's Divergent, and lacks tension and excitement.
rotten	When the drama boils down to a duel between Jeanine and Tris, there's a spark. Otherwise, it's a plodding letdown.
fresh	It least Insurgent has very lively performances from Woodley as the action heroine, James as her square-jawed beau, Ansel Elgort as her detached brother Caleb and Miles Teller (from Whiplash) as the Iago-like Peter.
rotten	It's impressive how the likes of Winslet, Spencer and Watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction.
rotten	A modest cultural artifact if one largely devoid of aesthetic interest.
fresh	Insurgent has more action than last year's debut film, which was modestly titled just Divergent. Action is what you want in a picture such as this, especially when you don't really have a lot on your mind.
fresh	A more effective, adult-friendly film than its predecessor.
fresh	It's a sequel that sticks to more routine territory of action, angst, and dystopian gloom - mostly a sound approach, thanks to the consistent strength of franchise lead Shailene Woodley and a mix of intended and inadvertent surprises.
rotten	There's suspension of disbelief and then there's what the Divergent movies require, which is a total rejection of the most basic concepts of humanity.
rotten	Woodley tries to emote a lot with her expressive eyes, but overall the film feels cold. Schwentke struggles to decide if "Insurgent" is more action or more YA and winds up doing neither genre much justice.
rotten	Maybe you had to read the book?
fresh	Some fans may object to substantial plot alterations, but the rejiggering streamlines and intensifies the story as it powers to the same destination.
rotten	"Insurgent" opens new horizons of repetitiveness, dramatic shapelessness, self-seriousness and a generalized oppressiveness ...
rotten	less interesting than exasperating
fresh	The action sequences are well done, some of the visuals are spectacular, and at it's heart Insurgent is wrestling with some very basic questions about ambition and human interaction.
fresh	Insurgent is not a subtle movie. But that doesn't mean the dystopian parable about finding your way in the world isn't powerful.
fresh	The first film was impossible to take seriously and that is still the case for the sequel. But it's less of a chore.
fresh	Taken for what it is, Insurgent is a vast improvement over the franchise's first installment, mostly thanks to expansion in two arenas: budget and scope.
fresh	Watch out Katniss, your competition is hard as nails.
rotten	The action scenes aren't enough to distract from a script that is full of holes, illogical actions and a story that takes almost two hours to complete yet only moves things forward a few baby steps.
fresh	A dystopian drama that salutes the heroism and compassion of a gifted young woman.
rotten	[Woodley] spends much of the second [film] captured by the society's merciless overlord (Kate Winslet) and locked into a psychoactive contraption that subjects her to various traumatic hallucinations. Any movie critic can relate to that.
rotten	The performances are fine. Everyone is solid, though they're not asked to do too much.
rotten	A trio of screenwriters (Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback) whisks us from one event to the next without providing the necessary details to support actions.
fresh	Smart, Slick and Superior to its predecessor.
fresh	It speeds past intricate intrigues and sketchy characterizations, moving like a sleek roller-coaster ride, free from clunky exposition.
rotten	Along the way, Tris has repeated nightmares about events from the last film she'd rather forget. I know how she feels.
fresh	Luckily for "Insurgent," Shailene Woodley is on board for the duration.
rotten	Were it not for the five lines of recognizably human dialogue spoken by Miles Teller, this whole thing would implode into a black hole.
rotten	Although Woodley is adequate at emoting - Tris being something of a basket case of guilt, self-loathing and teenage hormones - many of the other characters here are, by definition, one-dimensional.
rotten	"Insurgent" would be a much worse movie if the good parts were all at the beginning. But they are saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, "Well, that was OK," even though most of it wasn't.
fresh	If you've seen "Divergent," this builds on it nicely.
rotten	Fans of the first will love it. All others need not apply.
rotten	No one involved in the making of Insurgent would test positive for the intelligent Erudites
rotten	Even if you're curious about it, the movie is often plodding and frequently nonsensical, with action that never feels novel or exciting.
rotten	It delves even deeper into the poorly considered mythology, building action beats and moments of tension around a conceit that puts easy allegory ahead of logic or coherence.
rotten	An improvement on its predecessor...a workmanlike job, if an uninspired one.
rotten	Insurgent does get a few things right along the way, [but] they're completely overshadowed by the general dullness of the rest of the movie.
fresh	A sharp improvement on the original, this second entry in The Divergent Series has a much stronger sense of its premise and characters...
rotten	Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's last words were: "The horror! The horror is Tris's haircut!"
rotten	"Will someone please tell me what's going on?" Tris cries at one point, and she could be speaking for the audience as the plot becomes ever more muddled.
rotten	The cast still shines, but this mid-franchise movie is mostly spinning its wheels.
rotten	It scooped up the right star and it knows it; the film treats Woodley like a get-out-of-jail-free card for all its transgressions and fits of crappiness.
fresh	Woodley herself almost singlehandedly saves these films from being just another overwrought dystopian nightmare.
fresh	Woodley does solid work here as she's done elsewhere, and continues to be someone to watch...
fresh	Puts the urgent in Insurgent.
rotten	Jumps headfirst into the mythology of the franchise, so that the only way to have fun is to become truly invested. Which would be fine if the story were intriguing enough to bother.
rotten	Insurgent has more action than Divergent, but not much more excitement. Perhaps a more mercenary blockbuster mentality could have at least shaped that action into stronger set pieces.
rotten	Insurgent is often more exciting and more eye-catching than its predecessor. Too bad its characters aren't any more interesting.
fresh	Insurgent succeeds because it doesn't bother explaining a darn thing.
rotten	Insurgent is a relentlessly exasperating sci-fi film made, miraculously, with a half-baked imagination, a slaughtered wit, and insufferable direction by Robert Schwentke, the man who supplied 2013 with one its biggest flops, R.I.P.D.
rotten	A Little Golden Book version of drastically simplified socialism accompanied with a healthy dose of warmongering bravado.
fresh	Insurgent, half-baked as its universe might be, rattles and glimmers with an undeniable allure.
rotten	"Divergent" wasn't the strongest entry into the teen dystopian genre shared by the likes of "The Hunger Games" and "The Maze Runner," and this entry only further erodes the series' position.
fresh	The actors are more or less saving this franchise's bacon.
rotten	With its repeat itinerary, Insurgent is less a sequel than a remake. The movie has an ordinary middle-chapter scenario, and less The Empire Strikes Back than Attack of the Clones.
fresh	Woodley's performance is strong enough to carry everything else here: maybe being Divergent is just another word for star power.
rotten	Of the featured cast, only Woodley really achieves any lasting impact in this episode, although the ham-fisted writing sometimes leaves her a little too exposed.
rotten	Practically everyone you're watching seems to be wishing they were somewhere else. So you might want to take the hint.
rotten	There's also not much in the way of lightness or humour in these kinds of films.
rotten	It would've been nice to tell you Insurgent was surprisingly good. Or fun to rant and rave about how lousy it is. But no. It's just there, another middle installment of another teen-targeted post-apocalyptic series.
rotten	Long and violent but lacking narrative momentum, Insurgent is an inferior sequel to the already mediocre Divergent.
fresh	While I enjoyed the first Divergent movie, I did find Insurgent to be a better cinematic romp.
rotten	Trainloads of action abound (literally), but it's essentially generic combat. Punch, point, shoot, kill, get out of the way in the nick of time depending on your billing in the closing credits.
rotten	While the ending is meant to build up anticipation for the inevitable parts three and four, it plays as mostly resolved; you don't walk out of the theater thinking, I can't wait til the next one.
rotten	The only uprising that the regressive, repetitive and recycled Insurgent could ever incite might be in its viewers, rising up out of their seats and making a beeline for the theater doors.
fresh	That's a lot of back story to wade through and at times the expository world-building weighs heavy here too. But in "Insurgent," twists and developments bulk up the story and help further define the characters.
rotten	School is out forever in the Divergent series. And honestly, after all that set up, I don't know that this world is worth saving.
fresh	"It's disappointing that the script doesn't match the spectacular special effects on display, but it's still a compelling ride."
rotten	Woodley, great in "The Spectacular Now" and "The Fault in Our Stars," is a humdrum action star. Her amiable yet laid-back style turns the film's key moments from do-or-die into OK-whatever.
fresh	Sneakily undercuts tropes of the young-adult hero's journey. But in a more adventurous movie environment, this wouldn't feel this fresh as it does.
rotten	The plot makes zero sense and Shailene Woodley's on-screen chemistry with scowling hunk Four (Theo James) is non-existent.
fresh	The second chapter of the Divergent series is moderately engaging, but it's clear the impact of the franchise is inevitably deteriorating.
rotten	The Hunger Games' braindead younger sibling aims for dystopian gravitas but only succeeds at being dull and joyless.
rotten	The finale, at least, gives one hope that this series will finally diverge from its YA "Hunger Games" formula in the next film.
rotten	Maybe that's why signing up for this sound-a-like saga was secretly a smart move [for Woodley]. When you're watching Insurgent, trying to quell the boredom, all you can think about is how much better Shailene is than the movie around her.
fresh	Once you swallow the giant pill that is the premise, it just about makes sense, and Woodley sells it with all her conviction.
rotten	Those who found Divergent one young adult dystopia too far will find little in Robert Schwentke's sequel to lessen bewilderment.
fresh	A rising young star exhibits an impressive acting range in a physically as well as emotionally-demanding role promising to do for her what The Hunger Games did for Jennifer Lawrence.
rotten	Teenage kicks are in short supply in the preposterous second instalment of Veronica Roth's derivative Young Adult series.
rotten	Kate Winslet as the villainous, power-hungry, ice-cool blonde is the best thing in this overlong sequel in which spectacular special effects dominate and whose narrative is too cluttered to involve us beyond the superficial
fresh	It's getting hard to feel empathetic for people who live in future dystopian societies. Oh, boo hoo, your peaceful government collapsed and ... you are grouped by how handy you happen to be at some particular task. You know, we all have problems.
rotten	"I know this doesn't make any sense," breathes Tris Prior during Insurgent's flamboyantly muddled finale, "but you have to trust me." You could hardly ask for a more honest line of dialogue than that.
rotten	Perks up a bit when vets like Winslet or Octavia Spencer or Naomi Watts pop up for a scene or two, but for the most part, this all plays out like yet another movie about pretty young people in futuristic sportswear punching or shooting each other.
rotten	Even with breathless chases, strong design components and dazzling effects, the story's organizing principle -- the faction system that divides society into five groups based on personality -- grows less compelling as Insurgent proceeds.
rotten	Perhaps instead of splitting the third book into two movies, they should have considered combining the first two into one.
fresh	Even if it doesn't earn the sci-fi adventure franchise many new converts, Insurgent should retain the fan base created by last year's Divergent and keep it primed for the series' two-part Allegiant finale.
rotten	Despite its earnest tone and unremittingly solemn performances, the entire movie feels like a simulation, devoid of lifelike detail or tangible dramatic stakes.
rotten	This second Divergent entry is a more propulsive and action-centric outing, but it turns star Shailene Woodley into a passive observer in her own adventure.
rotten	Middle films in movie franchises run the risk of being devoid of closure and linearity, and it's that inconclusive nature to Robert Schwentke's Insurgent that proves to be its greatest misgiving.
rotten	Running contrary to its message, the film seems content to fit in rather than stand out from its numerous predecessors on stage and screen.
fresh	The problems with the story are still present - this is most certainly not a feminist polemic - but one can't help but be caught up in Branagh's theatrical spirit.
fresh	If the young girl who sat in front of me is to speak for children everywhere, they are going to adore this film.
fresh	takes the all-too-familiar beats of the story and plumbs them for deeper levels of feeling and physicality, merging the sensual and the chaste in a way that is uniquely compelling in its experiential bliss
fresh	Cate Blanchett steals her stepdaughter Cinders's show.
fresh	Lily James shines as Cinderella. [She] plays Ella with the right balance of sweetness and sincerity. It's a genuine and charming performance; she carries the film very well.
fresh	Based on the classic fairy tale, but borrowing heavily from the 1950 film, Cinderella is enchanting, a wonderful and stylish film with a charming lead and emotional narrative.
fresh	Disney's first-class, straight-faced, irony-free, live-action remake of its own 1950 animated classic is a delightful explosion of colour, costumes, virtue and snarling...a truly beautiful film.
fresh	Above all else, the best reason I can give to see this film is Cate Blanchett. She's incredibly good as the evil stepmother.
rotten	After dehydrating the pulpy fun from a Marvel superhero and Tom Clancy spies, you can imagine how Branagh mishandles Cinderella, reverent and corny when a touch of mockery wouldn't hurt.
rotten	It's hard to see this new Cinders as anything more than a brand-based cash grab when its sole function is to succeed (and perhaps replace) a movie that's ageless.
fresh	Cinderella is nice and serviceable, with a refreshing lack of twists on its universally recognisable story.
fresh	For the adult viewer, one of the joys of the film is the presence of Cate Blanchett, gloriously gowned, evoking the great female movie stars of the past (Joan Crawford, Bette Davis) as the Wicked Stepmother.
fresh	Special effects, Cate Blanchett make a familiar tale entertaining
fresh	With enough respect to eschew the easy option of modernising it with a hip and radical make-over, it's kind enough to the characters to get round the problematic sexual politics of the story without making a big statement about them.
fresh	Hollywood filmmakers are no slouches these days when it comes to subverting or sending-up fairy-tale conventions. But Kenneth Branagh does something much more daring. He plays things straight.
fresh	There's plenty to like, and a little to love.
fresh	Branagh and company whip up a handsome slice of old-fashioned family entertainment.
fresh	Darlings, just breathless with the news: Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella is a sumptuous, candy-coloured rush of romance, with added thespian backbone from Cate Blanchett as the evil stepmother.
fresh	Chris Weitz's screenplay updates the old Charles Perrault yarn in a fresh and witty way. The performances are very lively too.
fresh	In its lack of experiment, this latest Cinderella does feel positively experimental.
fresh	This is the film of a full-blown romantic who believes in true love, happy endings and the importance of an absolutely fabulous wardrobe.
fresh	A remarkably faithful, full-hearted live action rendition of Cinderella, well cast and sumptuously staged, picking its way carefully between Walt Disney's classic musical animation of 1950 and Perrault's definitive text.
fresh	The thing that makes this Disney live-action remake so wonderful is the same thing that might put off some audience members: it's a pure fairy tale...
fresh	The story is as enchanting as ever, the handsome cast doesn't miss a beat, while the costumes and set design are wonders to behold. But the movie's sheer flawlessness turns out to be a flaw in itself.
fresh	With all (the recent) twisting and sculpting of classic stories, it's refreshing to watch ... Cinderella because it remains largely faithful.
fresh	Slightly eerie in its dead-eyed coldness, but you get used to it.
rotten	There is a lot of dying early on and also quite a lot later on, when you will feel you are dying, of boredom, of ennui and, possibly, the full weight of the patriarchy, pressing down hard on your chest.
fresh	It's good-natured and silly, with nice support from Rob Brydon, Nonso Anozie, Derek Jacobi and Katie West.
fresh	Delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Perfectly. Beautifully. Magically.
fresh	Witty, richly drawn and unashamedly old school, this is a smart adaptation that understands the enduring appeal of its source material, and doesn't feel the need to subvert or reinvent.
fresh	This is an enchantment - with the occasional touch of nostalgia - just the way it should be.
fresh	There are times, particularly when the bland Madden is on screen, that the wholesomeness gets a bit much. But kids will likely have a ball.
fresh	Sumptuously appointed and elegantly well-acted, looks and feels magical and should delight even the most skeptical cynic.
fresh	Kenneth Branagh's lavish live-action telling of the folktale made familiar to many by Disney's 1950 animated feature film is a faithful take that derives pleasure in updating expectations and absolutely never dashing them.
fresh	The result is a pleasant surprise, and just goes to show: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
fresh	The Cinderella fable is a lot like Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah": it's been covered.
fresh	I wanna go to Disneyland! I wanna go to Disneyland right now!
rotten	It looks terrific. It's also faithful to a fault -- and that's exactly the problem, since it makes it on the dull, unadventurous side.
rotten	The studio has managed to do the impossible, and portray a version of the classic fairy tale heroine who's even more of an insipid doormat that the one in its 1950 animated classic.
fresh	Branagh pulls off the same sort of trick he did with Thor: he creates a visually overwhelming, heavily gilded world, and then keeps the focus on the characters within it.
fresh	If the film belongs to anyone, however, it is Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother, looking as though she could lacerate someone with her cheekbones.
fresh	Disney's live action Cinderella benefits from Ken Branagh's kudos in being able to attract the kind of cast and achieving the kind of tone such a well known and loved fairy tale needs
fresh	There are many highlights, but none more memorable than when the clock strikes midnight ...It's a bumpy ride for the radiant Ella (Lily James) ...as the pumpkin bursts - just like her dreams
fresh	Embraces its fairy tale roots with impressive eye candy.
fresh	Much Magic at Play in this "Cinderella."
fresh	Branagh makes this familiar tale feel so fresh, even though you know exactly where it's going, staging it with the full-scale splendor of a period drama rather than a bedtime story.
fresh	No matter how cynical you might be -- hardened by the current climate of remakes, reboots and incessant sequels -- it's impossible to avoid getting caught up in the magic of a little Bippidy-boppidy-boo.
fresh	The actors in the film all give strong performances. This film is gorgeously staged with wonderful costumes, sets and production design. Scenic locations are expertly lensed by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos.
fresh	'Cinderella' is made of Disney magic.
fresh	Nearly a century after that black-and-white cartoon short, and 65 years after a "classic" animated feature that missed the mark, Disney finally got Cinderella right -- for now and, happily, ever after.
fresh	Branagh knows how to sweep us up in the ecstatic thrall of the familiar without breaking from fantasy or making his central messages about bravery, compassion and self-confidence feel superficial.
fresh	Cinderella is a wonderfully realized family feature that retains the strengths of its source material while at the same time updating it for today's audiences.
fresh	The colors - good lord. They're like nothing you could experience in the real world. Cinderella's behemoth of a ball gown alone is 50 shades of blue.
rotten	Most fairy tales on film contain either enough wit or verve or spectacle to engage an entire audience, but there is nothing here to engage the adult viewer. Nothing.
fresh	Production values are outstanding, the actors give very watchable performances, and the glorious royal ball sequence simply takes your breath away.
fresh	Filmgoers need another fairy tale flick about as much as they need another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel (oops, too late), yet Cinderella swiftly casts aside all doubts and derision to reveal itself as a particularly enchanting piece of cinema.
fresh	... tweaks the more objectionable details of conventional fairy tales while still retaining their traditionalist structure. It's a nice compromise.
fresh	Elegant, enchanting re-imagining of the romantic folk tale for the 21st century...
fresh	I suppose I just wasn't wowed by it. Cinderella was exactly what I expected, which means it lived up to my expectations.
fresh	A lush, opulent, romantic fantasy that still believes in love at first sight. It's just that the dress has a lot -- but not everything -- to do with it.
fresh	Some of the supporting players, most resplendently Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother and Derek Jacobi as the ailing king, are very fine. The film never soars, though.
fresh	What it lacks in modern quirkiness compared to "The Princess Bride," "Cinderella" makes up for with a timelessness and a sincere embrace of its concept and characters.
fresh	Cinderella plays it overly-safe in transitioning from cartoon-to-live-action but is sure to entertain Disney's go-to juice box crowd.
fresh	It's a expansive, expensive faux-period romance with all of the resources and craftsmanship of the great British costume dramas ... but, you know, for kids.
fresh	'Cinderella' is a gorgeous production that is true to its fairy tale and animated roots, yet adds enough intrigue and situations to charm adults as well as youngsters.
rotten	I'm all for confection, but this movie takes that too far. Cinderella and the prince look like they belong on a wedding cake.
fresh	Kenneth Branagh and the filmmakers tried to make the story feel new again, and for the most part they succeeded. But oddly, the movie's best moments are the ones that didn't change at all.
fresh	Possibly the best adaptation of the classical fairy tale yet.
fresh	This movie is proof that sometimes the best way to play it is straight.
fresh	This "Cinderella" won't make anyone forget the 1950 classic... But it works as a frothy, fun retelling, entertaining on its own merits.
rotten	If it weren't for the imaginative and eye-catching costumes by three-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell, Cinderella could be mistaken for a typical Disney Channel special.
fresh	The story is retrograde malarkey, but Branagh infuses it with majesty and delivers a spectacle with flourish.
fresh	It might be easy to deride Disney for once again playing the Cinderella card, especially so soon after the meta-musical Into the Woods. But let's be thankful the people commissioned to retell the fairy tale didn't treat it as a moldy relic.
fresh	The new film... is nothing if not a tribute to old-fashioned virtues, of care and craft and modesty, of simple stories well told.
fresh	Beautifully directed by Kenneth Branagh, every fame sparkles with an opulent vibrancy that perfectly captures the faerie tale element.
fresh	It's almost too easy to make a parody of Cinderella. What's tough is to do is create a film this earnest and this lovely -- everything from the performances to the set design to the costumes -- that will play to the cynics of 2015.
fresh	Helena Bonham Carter is great dotty fun as Fairy Godmother.
rotten	Even with its attractive leads, Lily James and Richard Madden, grand fairy-tale settings and, when it counts, affecting moments, this live-action "Cinderella" is only modestly engaging.
rotten	A lavish, classy affair...But while long on beauty, Branagh's film falls short on whimsy...[and] the film's most affecting emotional moments...stand apart from the story's central conflict.
fresh	"Cinderella" feels real enough to be sincerely touching at the same time it's visually inventive enough to be magical. We've all seen this story, true; but we haven't seen it told this effectively.
fresh	Turn back the clock on filmmaking and get ready to be charmed by "Cinderella." Director Kenneth Branagh has outdone himself with this outstanding live-action version of the 1950 Disney animated classic.
fresh	Not just any "Cinderella", but genius visionary Kenneth Branagh's majestic, gorgeous, sweeping version of this beautiful tale of a kind, courageous girl.
fresh	It's a flawless production, filled with solid acting, fabulous costumes, music that captures the grandeur of the story, and a perfectly matched royal couple.
fresh	Every second I was amazed at the beautiful scenery, costume designs and the magic that was captured.
fresh	While the heroine's disinclination to stand up for herself doesn't relay the most feminist agenda, the maternal advice she lives by, to 'have courage and be kind,' is a message no one could fault. Director Kenneth Branagh once again surprises...
fresh	Directed by Kenneth Branagh with a sprinkling of stardust, dashes of good humor, and a respect for the corniest kinds of romance, Cinderella is a winning re-do of Disney's 1950 animated classic.
fresh	The 1950 Disney flick is 74-minutes. This one is 112. Does it need the extra 38-minutes? No. But it's a great story and a beautiful movie so the padding is forgivable.
fresh	This Cinderella isn't flashy and doesn't forge a new path, but it does have adorable mice to cheer for and a villain to hiss.
fresh	For a movie that has no reason to exist beyond maximizing Disney's back catalogue, Kenneth Branagh's live action Cinderella is an entirely enjoyable piece of fairy tale theater.
rotten	The audience already primed for more "happily ever after" will be more than satisfied with the results. Everyone else will wonder what the studio was/is thinking with this strategy.
fresh	They didn't turn Cinderella into an action heroine or reboot the story for our cynical age. And thank heavens for that...
fresh	It's old-fashioned in the right ways, just like Lily James is Cinderella in all of the right ways.
fresh	It is really lovely.
fresh	In being faithful to the traditional tale interpreted by Disney in their animated 1950 classic, this Cinderella is crisp escapist enjoyment.
rotten	For all its gossamer, gauze, filigree and refinement, "Cinderella" drags when it should skip as lightly as its title character when she's late getting home from the ball.
rotten	The movie grinds down ... in plot details that fatten the narrative while deflating the spirit.
fresh	Disney's new live-action "Cinderella" is not a reboot. It's a case of sliding a glass slipper on a movie to make sure it's the classic that studio executives are looking for.
fresh	Young children are guaranteed to love this, even though it's rated PG for no reason (fine, "mild thematic elements").
rotten	"Cinderella" is so scrubbed of personality, it's not even worth calling a mess.
fresh	Disney's Cinderella has been magically transformed into as sumptuous a live-action re-imagining of its 1950 animated classic as any princess could dream of.
rotten	Mr. Branagh's ascension into big-budget studio directing largely remains a mystery, and there's little in "Cinderella" beyond its faces and gowns that captures the eye or the imagination.
rotten	This "Cinderella" is all dressed up with nowhere very interesting to go.
fresh	[Branagh] manages to de-toxify Disney's flagship fairy tale without overcorrecting away its prettiness, sincerity, or charm.
fresh	They aim for the heart, not the head. Darned if they don't pull it off.
fresh	This fairy tale adaptation is as close as you can get to a dream come true.
fresh	As pure of heart as its heroine, "Cinderella" floats across the screen like a gossamer confection, full of elegant beauty and quiet grace.
fresh	Cinderella doesn't tear down and rebuild the classic giving us something fresh, innovative, and unrecognizable. Kenneth Branagh does a tremendous job of adapting a well-trod narrative, however.
fresh	Gorgeous, elegant and wondrous, the new live-action Cinderella is a jewel in Disney's treasure trove.
fresh	Disney's live-action retelling of its cornerstone princess tale is an often sparkling movie that never disrespects the kid audience even as it wins over the parents.
fresh	The film feels neither dated nor updated. Rather, it treads, with a light and careful step, the difficult middle path of timelessness.
fresh	Director Kenneth Branagh's lavish and live-action version of Disney's 1950 animation Cinderella delivers a colourful take that blends old-fashioned Mouse House heart with modern CG magic.
rotten	Even with Blanchett playing her, the stepmother remains the same uncomplicated villain she was in the 1950 Disney animated film. This is even more disappointing than the Cinderella character lacking gumption, since she's always been bland.
fresh	Disney's new live-action version is for the most part beguilingly good, even though it's no replacement for the studio's 1950 animated classic.
fresh	This is a sweet movie, a happy movie. There's no other way to put it, really. And if that sounds like it may register too low on the hipster meter to merit your consideration, well, your loss.
fresh	It's pleasing to come away from a movie such as "Cinderella" having felt something for, and with, the archetypes on the screen.
fresh	"Cinderella" has been made with enough skill and sincerity to disarm all but the most jaded viewers. It's a happy ending for everyone -- Disney's accountants most of all.
fresh	The world didn't need yet another "Cinderella" story, but the one we got is one of the best versions ever put on film.
fresh	The fizzy cocktail combination of Blanchett's cartoonish hauteur and Branagh's visual razzle-dazzle and confectionary sets manages to take a tale as wheezy as Cinderella and make it feel almost magical again.
rotten	A visually attractive but curiously flat retelling of the old chestnut.
fresh	True to the spirit of the classic story but fresh and filled with heart and magic.
fresh	Its goal is simply to tell this story without much embellishment or distraction but, more importantly, to tell it with plenty of care and admiration.
fresh	...there is no harm in getting yourself momentarily overjoyed and swept away by all the magic.
rotten	If you're looking for a tried-and-true telling filled with elaborate settings and beautiful ball gowns, this glass slipper is the right fit. However, if you're looking for a fresh, modern take on your average fairy tale, don't bother trying on this one.
fresh	All concerned here really believed in this project and put a lot of love in it. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
fresh	Tackling the fairytale in such a direct manner could have been Branagh's undoing. Instead, he presents the tale with such joy and passion that it becomes a nostalgic journey to a time of childhood dreams.
fresh	There's precious little to carp about in the new release, unless you choose to take exception to the fact that there's precious little to carp about.
fresh	If you can get past the giant pumpkin in the ballroom - really, why bother to remake Cinderella in 2015 if you have no new spin on the material? - there's a lot to like about director Kenneth Branagh's gorgeously fanciful tale.
fresh	The visual design is exquisite, coming remarkably close to replicating the original movie's Technicolor splendor.
fresh	A magical, emotionally affecting screen version of this classic fairy tale.
fresh	The film dares you not to like it with its sumptuous craftsmanship, fine actors and heart-felt sentiments.
fresh	It's all so very enchanting, just as a fairy tale should be.
fresh	While the music of the animated original is missed, almost everything about Cinderella is well done.
fresh	It sticks to the tried-and-true -- so much so that surprises are few -- but under the watchful eye of the quality team assembled, this "Cinderella" does the story justice.
fresh	Cinderella and her Prince get a bit lost in all the flounces and flouncing, but they don't seem to mind -- you, and legions of tiara-clad little girls, quite possibly won't either.
fresh	Little girls-of all ages-will have a great time...
fresh	The story of the abused but honest poor girl who wins the heart of a prince couldn't have landed in better hands.
fresh	Cinderella practices what it preaches by having courage, being kind, and exceeding all expectations.
rotten	Disney's live-action version of the familiar fairytale boasts a glittery cast, but the overwhelming production design eats its own scenery.
fresh	Branagh and company are probably making this version not just for us jaded adults but for a generation of children who perhaps never had a chance to see "Cinderella" on a big screen. For them, it will be a brand new adventure.
fresh	Cate Blanchett is perfectly marvelous. Nothing steals a scene from her, except Sandy Powell's costumes and Dante Ferretti's production design, which are all kinds of wonderful.
fresh	A charming and wonderfully-enchanting film. Director Kenneth Branagh proves that he's more than up to the task of bringing this delightful story to the big screen in a new and unique way.
fresh	Branagh has cracked the Disney do-over code with "Cinderella," hopefully gluing the creative dials in place for all future productions.
rotten	Gone are the active, spunky heroines of recent Disney efforts, and in their place is a bland, pre-modern one.
rotten	Really, really made me mad. Like, seething. Like, I want this entire review to be: WHAT IS THE POINT WHAT IS THE POINT WHAT IS THE POINT WHAT IS THE POINT WHAT IS THE POINT?!
rotten	It's easy to get swept up in the prettiness of it all, and hard to give a damn whether it might end one minute or the next.
rotten	It's a lavish, handsomely staged production, but it's also dramatically inert, a pretty diorama led by a pair of good-looking but forgettable TV actors.
fresh	Sweeping, intimate and whimsical, "Cinderella" does the Disney brand proud with a faithful yet expansive retelling that never misplaces its heart in exchange for shallow extravagance. This is one happily ever after worth believing.
fresh	Steeped in a dazzling array of confectionary colors and sparkling magical whimsy that compares beautifully to the 1950 animated classic, Cinderella makes a strong case to be first in our thoughts.
fresh	Kenneth Branagh's "Cinderella" does something extraordinarily rare among fairy-tale adaptations: It leaves out nothing we want and adds nothing we don't.
fresh	A gorgeous re-imagining, bringing to life the specific beauty and charm of the fairy tale. But it's also rather hollow, doing little to add its own spin.
fresh	"Cinderella" isn't just a re-enactment of the original film but an enrichment. For Disney fans, it could be another treasure worth cherishing.
fresh	Without resorting to post-Wicked good-girl/bad-girl reversals in the manner of Maleficent and (dare I say it?) Frozen, Branagh and Weitz see the fairy tale afresh.
fresh	Such a gallant anachronism...that it offers, without ever raising its voice, a ringing cross-examination of our whole era of dark, gritty fairy-tale revisionism.
fresh	Cinderella is a balmy but beautiful take on both the 1950 cartoon and the original Charles Perrault fairy tale.
fresh	Branagh has modernized the spirit of Cinderella, while staying true to its roots with a lovely French countryside meets mini-Versailles setting, lush romantic lighting and costumes, and most important, a goodhearted core.
fresh	There are handsome palaces and forests and computer animated renderings of squeaking mice and geese turning into Cinderella's party entourage. But the real reason to see it is the humans.
fresh	Such a beautiful film, Walt Disney himself would be proud of his namesake company for making it.
rotten	This new Cinderella tells more or less the same tale with little variation in terms of story (fair enough), tone (problematic), or characterization (very problematic).
fresh	I could choke on it all, like a 24-hour binge of buttercream cake frosting. But let's be honest. There is no denying the fact that this is the best Cinderella of them all.
fresh	After all the other films that seem to be aimed at them and really aren't, little children and the people who love them could really use a slice of simply delicious cake like this.
fresh	Yes, it's enchanting, but this beautiful version is also something very much more.
fresh	With beautiful visuals and a sense of fun, director Kenneth Branagh has crafted a fetching, playful delight.
rotten	The filmmakers cut the film to emphasize the story's familiar plot points, rather than highlight any instances of personal visual artistry.
fresh	Young girls and adult Disney fans should really enjoy Cinderella, but if simply watching the original cartoon doesn't sound appealing to you, then this live-action version won't be of interest to you either.
fresh	This telling of Cinderella adheres strictly to that book. And yet it's a lavish delight sure to enchant audiences of all ages well past midnight.
fresh	Here's how magic happens: you take the familiar and transform it into something extraordinary.
fresh	By believing in the story's timeless beauty, and infusing it with enough visual splendor and empowering ideology to delight modern audiences, Kenneth Branagh has made a Cinderella so unexpectedly magical as to rival Disney's original.
fresh	This is a straight, no-chaser fairy story, a picture to be downed with pleasure. It worries little about sending the wrong message and instead trusts us to decode its politics, sexual and otherwise, on our own.
fresh	Enchanting and beautifully filmed. Disney's live action translation of their 1950 animated classic is the perfect family movie. A great cast includes the stunning Lily James and a complex evil Stepmother from the great Cate Blanchett.
fresh	Those without a sweet tooth might be turned off by this saccharine-ish movie, but I was won over, seduced by its warmth and easy good looks, its quaint, modest proportions.
rotten	A lovely, lifeless and mirthless corpse
fresh	Branagh, working with a high-wattage cast led by the winsome and genuine Lily James, sticks to tried-and-true narrative formula, and infuses it with wit and style. If the glass slipper ain't broke, he seems to be saying, why fix it?
fresh	What crowns the movie, flourishing the fullness of its purpose, is color.
rotten	A product of the Disney princess machine. Its highest ambition is to move a new line of toys. Or to evoke despair in the fairy-tale-ization of girls' lives.
fresh	[VIDEO ESSAY] Branagh's well-steeped history of producing, directing, and acting in film versions of Shakespeare's plays echoes in the context of a much beloved, (formerly animated) children's classic.
fresh	A retrograde fantasy with the depth of a dressing-up box, but it's spirited, genuinely funny and played to the hilt by an excellent cast.
fresh	Sitting in theater its hard not to get swept up in Branagh's old-fashioned cinematic magic.
fresh	Most recent Disney movies look suspiciously at traditional fables and their values. This Cinderella wants viewers to believe in them with every fiber of their being.
rotten	Making such a traditional Cinderella film really illustrates what a weak story Cinderella is to begin with.
fresh	Faithful to the story and tone of the original, but goosed with just enough character development that it doesn't feel socially backward. If anything, it's really quite magical.
fresh	Cinderella enthralls with its ravishing style and timeless message of resilience, decency and kindness triumphing over evil.
fresh	Very little is out of place in Branagh's do-over, but that's almost a problem: there's a feeling, throughout, of going perfectly through the motions.
fresh	This glass slipper may look a bit cold and univiting because it's so familiar, but it is also -- as the Fairy Godmother points out -- surprisingly comfortable once you try it.
fresh	Uplifting and full of that hard-to-capture sparkling sense of wonder, this is an enthralling addition to the trustworthy Disney brand of memorable, magical fairy tales.
fresh	It's all very sweet and harmless, though you can't help wishing that Cinders got her happy ending for more than being kind to her digital mice and weathering a lot of crap with a never-ending smile on her face.
fresh	Walt Disney's Cinderella is the best film yet in their "turn our animated classics into live-action blockbusters" sub-genre.
fresh	While it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm.
fresh	"Cinderella" does not try to be transgressive, or even progressive, and unashamedly sells itself as the old-fashioned wish-fulfillment little-girl fantasy that 'Fifty Shades' tries to whip its way out of.
fresh	Such is the affable tone and vivacious, good-natured spirit of this charming piece of cinema, that you are able to look past any flaws, and enjoy this for what it is.
fresh	Anyone nostalgic for childhood dreams of transformation will find something to enjoy in an uplifting movie that invests warm sentiment in universal themes of loss and resilience, experience and maturity.
fresh	Though this lavish, live-action 'Cinderella' could never replace Disney's animated classic, it's no ugly stepsister, either.
fresh	Provides a little geopolitical context for the story's fantasy kingdom, without forfeiting the magic - both supernatural and romantic - that has made Cinderella such an enduringly necessary tale for generation after generation.
rotten	Any reasonable chance to become poignant or profound is squandered by an approach that tries so hard to yank at the heartstrings that it unintentionally feels more cynical than uplifting.
rotten	For all its unsubtle sentimentality, it remains unclear whether Little Boy intends to celebrate the conviction of belief or to mock it.
fresh	A small film that stands tall in the field of family entertainment.
rotten	Filmmakers have been manipulating moviegoers' emotions since the beginning of this art form. However, rarely has one film been so patently blatant in those efforts than "Little Boy".
fresh	"Little Boy" is shamelessly sentimental, highly manipulative and wears out its welcome. Yet despite all that, I still enjoyed the film, for the most part, thanks to an endearing performance by its young star, Jakob Salvati.
rotten	... home-front family drama of hope, friendship, and faith, shot through the sepia-tinged light and faded hues of nostalgia...
fresh	Funny, inspiring, great family film
rotten	There are too many messages here, and too many of them mixed or conflicting.
rotten	The result is savvy, but shallow: Monteverde may end up selling more tickets, but he won't change any souls.
rotten	Despite boasting several important moral lessons, the period piece is more artificial than a polyester teddy bear stuffed with Splenda and Cheez Whiz - and about as appealing
fresh	Young boy's faith pulls heartstrings in sentimental drama.
fresh	One of those films that oozes with all-too-obvious manipulation, but nonetheless manages to be entertaining enough to just barely overlook or at least not mind the trickery. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Built on good intentions and flimsy ideologies, this film collapses, undoing any good it has done by moving from moral to moral with the same attention span of a child.
rotten	It's meant to be a tale of uplift for faith-based audiences, but instead wears viewers down with a heavy-handed narrative, an overbearing score and voiceover that spells out everything in cringe-inducing, folksy tones.
rotten	The movie starts down an honest path near the conclusion, but Monteverde and Portillo can't follow through on it.
rotten	Tolerance, World War II history and faith are served up with a sticky sentimental gloss in the family film "Little Boy."
rotten	A movie that has the haranguing inspirational tone of a marathon Sunday-school lesson.
rotten	I just wish the filmmakers didn't feel like they had to hit us over the head with all the moral pontificating to get their point across.
rotten	hard to hate... but easy to dismiss as well.
rotten	"Little Boy" is a as phony as a game of three-card monte.
rotten	"Little Boy" answers a question most tear-jerkers wouldn't have the nerve to ask: Can the bombing of Hiroshima be manipulated narratively, if briefly, into a position of warming our hearts? The answer is no.
rotten	This is an ersatz version of the '40s based on other movies' ersatz versions, a Candyland-colored world seen from a child's point of view if that child was a 30-ish filmmaker.
rotten	Terribly earnest and earnestly terrible...bungles its good intentions in a welter of mixed signals and mangled messages.
rotten	Little Boy is guilty of trying too hard. Had it just focused on a youngster's heartbreaking efforts to get his father home from the war, it would have been a touching tale.Sadly, that story gets bogged down by overly sentimental plot lines.
rotten	The lessons are so pat that every moment in which Pepper makes a good moral choice feels like an act of self-congratulation.
fresh	One of the most insightful films about religion since the 1977 comedy "Oh, God!," which also wrangled with personal beliefs and unprovable truths.
rotten	It will likely appeal to the faithful, but that's as far as it goes.
rotten	Emily Watson plays the boy's mother and Tom Wilkinson turns up as a gentle parish priest, so this must have looked better on paper than it does onscreen.
rotten	The film has a good cast, and is competently made in a plain-vanilla way, but its greatest appeal will be to those who share its endorsement of traditional religious values.
rotten	A confused mess of Christian morality parading as entertainment, and one that no benevolent God would wish upon the world.
rotten	It takes no genius to guess where this story is going, but whatever dramatic validity the movie had is lost in the have-your-cake-and-eat-it finale. It's a jaw-dropper.
rotten	"Believe the impossible," the tagline commands. It's a promise this shameless film has no intention of breaking.
rotten	Honestly, it's difficult to fathom how a filmmaker can, on one hand, so capably handle his film's faith elements but so mishandle others.
rotten	Instead of being rated PG-13, this one should be slapped with the label PG-65, because it's hard to imagine anyone younger than that getting caught up in this earnest, obvious fable.
rotten	Somewhere amid the storytelling rubble in "Little Boy" there's a decent message against racial prejudice. But it's suffocated beneath a hokey premise and hopelessly square execution.
rotten	A good cast and an overload of sincere teachable moments can't quite redeem this misshapen faith-based period piece.
fresh	This movie could make you pre-diabetic. That's an observation, not a criticism.
rotten	[A] cynical, poisonous, deeply stupid film ...
rotten	The problem here isn't theological; even if it were in service of a different message entirely, the sheer gracelessness of Monteverde's storytelling would be a massive turnoff.
rotten	It conveys life experience to such a sentimentalized degree that the world comes to resemble only the sham of a Norman Rockwell painting.
rotten	The entire picture, though well-meaning and even thoughtful, is finally just a little too gooey.
rotten	A drearily sincere movie about faith and tolerance, Little Boy boasts plenty of good intentions but very little else.
fresh	Sharply directed by Simon Curtis, the film is an intriguing mystery as, little by little, more and more information comes across the viewer's desk
rotten	Art-history aficionados might appreciate the debate over the legal and sentimental value of iconic paintings, but modern-day contrivances compromise much of the historical significance.
fresh	Helen Mirren delivers a strong performance in this predictable but well-crafted historical drama.
rotten	In their eagerness to make this into a feel-good story, Curtis and Campbell have turned their characters from multifaceted human beings into symbols who utter soundbites.
fresh	There is suspense, drama and emotion in this story. Reynolds and Mirren give great performances with good supporting performances by Daniel Bruhl, Katie Holmes and Allan Corduner.
fresh	Crusty octogenarian and exasperated man team up to wring justice from 50-yr-old wrongs. . .with charged interplay. . .to make legacy of Nazis' plunder of art a personal cause
fresh	We might not give this film much thought long after we have seen it... we will surely remember the beauty with which the past comes alive right before Maria's eyes.
rotten	It won't do the film any harm at the box office that Helen Mirren twinkles indomitably. She's as good as ever, but really - of all the things you want to see Dame Helen doing indomitably, twinkling isn't among them.
rotten	It makes a dull movie out of a fascinating piece of history.
fresh	Corny, commercial, predictably platitudinous, and tear-jerkingly weepy...also an inevitably thought-provoking dramatization of facing the 'ghosts' of the past on an individual level and a national one.
rotten	Your movie's flashback sub-plot shouldn't draw attention to how dull your actual central plot is.
rotten	Clearly, the most significant 'Woman in Gold' here is not the portrait nor Adele Bloch-Bauer herself (portrayed in flashback by Antje Traue) but our lead actress, the indomitable Oscar-winner, Helen Mirren,
fresh	The film is forgivably simplistic and sentimental but also stirring when it reminds us once again of the countless injustices from the Nazi era that can never be made right or forgotten.
fresh	A deeply moving and very satisfying piece of entertainment that knits up seemingly disparate elements in a tapestry of family pain and pride.
fresh	Helen Mirren is, of course, a wonderful actress, and she brings dignity to the marvellously Euro-chic Maria, but even she can't soar above the script which veers from speechifying to banalities.
rotten	Take a complex legal issue like the provenance of an art object, then throw in Helen Mirren and the Nazis as the hero and villains, and you have the dull and simplified tale of Woman in Gold.
fresh	Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes. This one really works.
fresh	Mirren's performance gains in depth and pathos as the film progresses.
fresh	There is much to recommend in Woman in Gold.
fresh	It's an intriguing David vs Goliath battle and Mirren positively glows with indignation.
fresh	This follows the fascinating story of Maria Altmann, a Jewish refugee who fled from Austria to escape the Nazi occupation of Vienna.
rotten	There's a terrible and relentless TV-movie ropiness about this film, combined with a dairy whiff of cheesiness.
fresh	Despite a debatable focus and dubious moralizing -money plays a pivotal role in the final outcome - "The Woman in Gold" works, largely because of the odd-couple chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds.
fresh	This fascinating true story is strong enough to hold up against the formulaic Hollywood treatment, boosted by another riveting performance from Helen Mirren...
rotten	In pursuit of prestige, it loses the qualities that make the story worth telling.
fresh	Curtis has so carefully crafted the film, and Mirren and Reynolds have such terrific chemistry, that it mostly works -- and it works pretty well at that.
fresh	Helen Mirren has become like Meryl Streep: nearly every time she has a leading role a little alarm goes off that signals Oscar gold.
rotten	Curtis' film stumbles in its digressions, lacking clear direction, along with the emotional impact it so desperately needs.
fresh	A conventional but powerful story.
fresh	Shrewdly compelling - with the incomprable Helen Mirren as the refined yet tartly obdurate propelling force.
fresh	The Helen Mirrens of the film world can often elevate whatsoever vehicle.
fresh	Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds make a great pair in this fascinating and true tale that makes for a highly entertaining and compelling tale.
rotten	Mirren is wonderful as always as the frank, spirited, adorable Maria, a shimmering bright spot as dazzling as the film's titular painting.
rotten	Director Simon Curtis is lucky to have Helen Mirren on hand, since she can turn the film's art history speeches into something that sounds like conversation. But the screenplay doesn't do either of them any favors.
rotten	Woman in Gold plays out like a filmic series of check-lists for legal and historical drama. It'll fit nicely into an AP Art History curriculum on a rainy day - only 20 flashbacks to go once you start.
fresh	Mirren is her usual stellar self, but the pleasant surprise here is Ryan Reynolds.
fresh	Helen Mirren is best part of fact-based historical drama.
fresh	This one only comes off as adequate and doesn't hit the emotional moments as hard as it should have. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Director Simon Curtis milks the predictable drama, thrills and heartache of the Holocaust-era story, but it's a paint-by-numbers triumph, a copy of something we've seen many times before.
rotten	"Woman in Gold" may be a bit obvious, but it's still a story worth telling.
rotten	Next to Mirren, [Reynolds is] like a dope in a museum, trying to be respectful of the genius around him but unable to sit still.
fresh	For all its broad brush strokes, Woman in Gold can't help but tell a moving populist parable about the will to power of an ordinary woman ... taking on powerful institutions to regain a tiny fraction of her family's appalling losses.
fresh	A wholly captivating Mirren makes Woman in Gold a positive film-going experience...
fresh	Mirren, sporting an accent that's about as close to Viennese as an English Dame can likely get, imbues Maria with pluck, high dignity and a vulnerability that's kept hidden beneath exterior reserve.
rotten	A movie that tells a real-life story yet rings utterly false.
rotten	Even boasting the pooled charisma of stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, Woman in Gold turns out to be a sputtering, clunky machine.
rotten	The Nazis' illegal seizure of hundreds of thousands of artworks -- the subject of the fine 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa -- becomes the pretext for heavy-handed sentimentality in this British-American docudrama.
fresh	Mirren is the single reason to watch the movie.
rotten	Based on a true story about a fight for justice wrapped in passion, memory and determination, and told using the considerable talents of Helen Mirren, Woman in Gold should be a much better movie.
rotten	Even Helen Mirren, the Queen Midas of class acting, can't fix this well-intentioned miss.
rotten	While the story is truly one of a kind, the film often feels like a TV movie of the week, even one of those treacly Hallmark productions.
rotten	"Woman in Gold" is dutiful and surprisingly dull, rolling along pre-ordained tracks and the familiar cadences of screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell's dialogue and situations.
rotten	The film does have an asset that can't be ignored, and that's Helen Mirren's tip-top performance as the film's costar. It's not enough to save the picture, but it certainly makes a difference.
fresh	Stirring at times, soggy and overly sentimental at others, the film moves surprisingly slow, even though its action, which takes place over many years of legal maneuvering, has been condensed for narrative expediency.
rotten	The relationship between Altmann and Schoenberg, sometimes testy but always loving, plays out like two actors acting, rather than two actors inhabiting a real situation.
rotten	Woman In Gold bends a complicated legal quagmire-heavy on questions of ownership and national responsibility-into a crowd-pleasing David and Goliath story. The title, too generic for Klimt's masterpiece, suits the movie just fine.
rotten	Great story, cliche-clogged script.
fresh	Like most dramas, it seeks to connect with its audience and, providing they are open to the story it's telling, it works both as a reminder of past wrongs and an assurance that justice sometimes triumphs.
fresh	Despite surges in exaggeration, "Woman in Gold" captures the spirit of Altmann's quest with efficiency, making for a satisfactory drama with deeply felt performances.
rotten	Sweet and dull. Makes you wonder what was left out.
fresh	It's a touching film that entertains with warmth and humor while teaching us something about history, law and justice with enormous heart, subtlety and compassion, brilliantly acted and skillfully written. Is there anything Helen Mirren cannot do?
fresh	A great movie? Probably not - but a compelling and involving one, dealing with an important moment in recent history? Woman in Gold is absolutely that.
fresh	The engaging but perfunctory Woman in Gold isn't exactly an exercise in subtlety, but this eager-to-please film proves that the formidable Helen Mirren can provide interesting nuances even in a story where few exist.
fresh	a brilliant movie...with many flashbacks to 1938 Vienna...that includes enticing cinematography of the Austrian locations...and fine acting. Just watching Helen Mirren is, as always, worth the price of admission.
rotten	There's a human-interest story at the bottom of this bombast, but it's hard to see the actual people through the weight of history, horror, and hagiography being piled atop them.
rotten	It's all a little tired and condescending - like some screenwriter's self-serving memories of his last trip to see Mom - and having Mirren occasionally exclaim what fun or thrills they're having doesn't make it so.
rotten	The star power of Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds is critically muted in this flatly directed true story.
rotten	Yes, it's based on a true story, a story that is compelling in its own right. But that doesn't mean the filmmakers get a free pass in presenting it to us.
rotten	Rich details but thin characters make for a disappointingly flat drama.
fresh	The film lets us see the tensions and sadness that are inevitable in a story like this, but also offers some wry humor.
fresh	Not only is the truth unforgettable, heartbreaking and triumphant, but Mirren, Reynolds and Bruhl make it all the more special.
fresh	A powerful drama that packs an eloquent and emotional punch, yet has enough of a sense of humor to occasionally lighten the mood.
fresh	Understands the challenge and importance of remembering the painful past, especially in light of those who believe that today's lingering prejudices are perfectly acceptable.
fresh	And now this movie is a part of its story, putting Adele back into the picture and giving us a portrait of the niece who insisted that her story be told.
fresh	The film is saved by engaging performances from Mirren and Reynolds, who shine as their characters' relationship deepens.
fresh	After seeing the film's touching final title cards briefly describing the fates of the characters, I couldn't help wishing for a documentary version.
fresh	Woman in Gold has a great story to tell, and the filmmakers have opted for the safest, slickest way to tell it.
fresh	What we get here is a film that understands that context matters.
fresh	Simon Curtis' "Woman in Gold" is a shamelessly sentimental fictionalization of this true story, but it's a fascinating story nonetheless, beautifully photographed and greatly elevated by a brilliant performance from the invaluable Helen Mirren.
rotten	A legal fight over the struggle for ownership of an artwork is hardly the stuff of high drama. And the screenplay can't find a way to make that conflict, or the ethical and moral issues involved, compelling ...
rotten	The film evades all but the most careful commonplaces about the relationship between the viewer and the work of art at its center.
rotten	Offers nothing that a documentary or even a long magazine article about Altmann and Schoenberg's triumph couldn't have captured better. For a film about a timeless painting, it's surprisingly artless.
fresh	Tatiana Maslay breathes new energy into the movie whenever she appears
rotten	The behind-the-camera contributions--along with Mirren's presence--mark this as a prestige production, but the unsubtle, prosaic treatment--along with the bland Reynolds--vitiates the effort.
fresh	A rousing drama about a Jewish refugee who is looking for closure on her terrible past and a young lawyer who matures spiritually.
fresh	What Woman in Gold has over nonfiction portrayals is emotion, and director Simon Curtis milks every scene for its heart-tugging potential.
rotten	Under Harvey Weinstein's sponsorship, this remarkable story has become a paint-by-numbers variation on the producer's far better "Philomena."
rotten	When not returning to the Nazi regime's war crimes, the story becomes a rather legalistic quest for justice. Campbell's cumbersome dialogue often sounds copied from legal documents.
rotten	It's potent material that becomes the stuff of a workmanlike true-life drama, spoon-feeding its audience a steady diet of speeches and schmaltz.
fresh	Gloriously shot, finely acted.
rotten	The real life heroes of this gutsy story deserve far better than the dumbed down and white washed treatment they get here.
fresh	Even with a starry cast, the stirring true story is this drama's standout feature.
rotten	The extraordinary story of a Gustav Klimt painting, reduced to a distinctly ordinary film.
rotten	Woman in Gold reaches for glossy, based-on-a-true-story cinematic heights with the depth of one of its made-for-television counterparts.
fresh	It's a heartwarming story of belated justice, soppy enough in its pre-war flashbacks, but strong in its morality and sympathy: no ambiguities here.
fresh	A thoughtful and at times stirring true-life account of a Holocaust refugee's quest to recover five Gustav Klimt paintings stolen by the Nazis
fresh	Much better than the buzz out of Berlin would suggest. Helen Mirren is excellent.
rotten	High art meets lowest common denominator appeal in Woman in Gold, a tribute to one woman's struggle that has the daring and originality of a fridge magnet.
fresh	Mirren is as excellent as always in the lead, but the actress is let down by the filmmaker's inclination to be so cliched on occasion, undermining this narrative with frustrating conventionality.
rotten	A film that hides its actual badness under a tarpaulin of mediocrity so thick and heavy it's difficult to even lift a corner to peek beneath, for a while I wasn't quite sure why I hated "Woman in Gold" so very, very much.
rotten	While Helen Mirren elevates the material with her usual aplomb and the events being depicted inevitably are stirring, this is a stodgy crusade-for-justice drama, directed and written with minimal flair.
rotten	This heavy-handed retelling of the fight to reclaim a Gustav Klimt painting stolen by Nazis is no masterpiece.
rotten	Woman in Gold ... has, in the shape of Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, one of those on-screen partnerships that the world wasn't waiting for.
fresh	"The Water Diviner" is a first rate classic that's sure to be remembered come Oscar time.
fresh	Its journey of healing and self-discovery can be felt a century and a continent away.
rotten	I think Crowe wanted to make a film that brought to mind David Lean and John Huston. But, as we all know, they don't make them like they used to. If he accomplishes anything with this movie, it's to remind us that's mainly because they can't.
fresh	A brawny historical melodrama with a twinge of magic realism amongst the oft-conflicting tones, what the movie lacks in discipline and polish it makes up for in sheer sincerity.
fresh	Russell Crowe makes his directing debut with this poignant, somber historical drama.
rotten	"The Water Diviner" is an uneven effort by first-time director Russell Crowe, and the occasionally preposterous screenplay by Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios doesn't exactly help Crowe as director, either.
fresh	A notably ambitious endeavor that thrives when it's focused on the main character and his family but falters when it focuses on an unnecessary romantic subplot.
fresh	Indeed, this is the 51-year-old Crowe's first time as a movie director, but he's hardly a novice actor stepping behind the camera for some sort of vanity project.
fresh	The Water Diviner qualifies as a valiant, even worthwhile, effort, even if in the long run it's nothing to, err, crow about.
rotten	Russell Crowe's towering performance makes up for his directorial shortcomings.
rotten	Crowe, who's been having a rough time finding his footing again for a decade now, underplays his role so self-consciously that when he wants us to feel his pain, all we feel is his ego. He fails to move us. And so does The Water Diviner.
rotten	It's clear that Russell Crowe has poured his heart and soul into the historical romance The Water Diviner, his first feature as a director. If only the film were better.
fresh	...tells a moving tale of a man's love for his sons and the lengths he is willing to go to return his boys home.
rotten	A sloggy, heartfelt piece of quasi-magical realist storytelling.
fresh	Russell Crowe's feature directorial debut is a triumph for him, an epic adventure and humane story that reminds me of the kind of movies I used to love before Hollywood found gold in them thar comic books.
fresh	'The Water Diviner' may not be perfect, but for a guy dabbling in a different career, it's a pretty good start.
fresh	Crowe lets his ego get the better of his judgement as director and star. It's no "Gallipoli." But it has moments of great power.
fresh	Crowe strives to strike a universal chord about the futility of war. Simplistic? Maybe. But in crafting a film about the pain a parent feels after losing a child in battle, Crowe transcends borders and politics.
rotten	Violent WWI-era drama wastes story's potential.
fresh	Russell Crowe moves behind the camera for the first time for this heartfelt, if inconsistently directed, story
rotten	Crowe needs, badly, a director to push back against his default mode: The script for The Water Diviner posits that Joshua Connor is the most interesting man in the frame at all times, but Crowe's performance doesn't earn that.
fresh	As in many of his previous roles, Crowe brings a credible & heartfelt gravitas to his character, & one can easily feel his pain and empathize with that and his quest. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
rotten	A diviner is a person who can predict the future, but that doesn't excuse why The Water Diviner was predictable and lacking fluidity.
fresh	Even slightly self-censored, its images of broken cities and the walking wounded is a strong restating of the film's message: There is no such thing as a "good" war. There's only war - sometimes necessary, sometimes not. And always inhuman.
rotten	To watch "The Water Diviner" it be warned constantly that we must break ourselves of our addiction to imagery that the film we're watching can't seem to resist.
fresh	Before the script by Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios yields to a Hollywood-style ending that doesn't fit, it makes poignant points about the futility of combat (especially World War I, the most meaningless war of the last century).
rotten	Water seeks its own level and Crowe, while in over his head, will find his audience.
rotten	The Water Diviner almost succeeds by way of its unfaltering sincerity, but the movie is too unfocused ... for it to have much of an effect.
fresh	The film feels purposeful and true. Good job, mate.
rotten	Despite the incongruous romance and abrupt action beats, Crowe gives a likable, sympathetic performance. But it all starts to dry up before our eyes.
rotten	"The Water Diviner" takes some strange detours, and the storytelling demands of the sprawling epic get to be too much for Crowe.
fresh	"The Water Diviner" can't help itself with unnecessarily romantic pursuits, but fringe interests fail to implode this sturdily constructed film.
fresh	Before it detours into not one, not two, but at least three preposterous Hollywood twists, "The Water Diviner" is an absorbing drama.
fresh	The awfulness and futility of war are seared onto the screen, in images that are often hard to look at.
fresh	If you can keep in mind that the whole thing is an Australian tweak of the magic carpet story from The Arabian Nights, you can probably enjoy this improbable, episodic, and earnestly entertaining...story.
rotten	The Water Diviner has some compelling moments, yet its magical realism jars against the grave historical subject matter.
rotten	You don't have to be a historian to wonder about the timing of the opening or a critic to regret that Mr. Crowe has signed onto a preposterous, would-be sweeping historical romance that's far too slight and silly to carry the weight of real history.
rotten	feels like an affront - and a waste of time
rotten	While the war story aims for epic turf, the love story settles for manipulation.
rotten	Assuming you buy that a noble man of the earth can use his divining skills to locate loved ones in the muddy remains of war, there's plenty else that stretches credibility in Crowe's film.
fresh	It suggests nothing so much as a movie version of a book-club novel that has yet to be written. That doesn't have to be an insult, and it isn't.
fresh	After toiling for the likes of Ridley Scott, Ron Howard, and Peter Weir all these years, Crowe takes command of his own camera crews and castmates, mounting an ambitious and sentimental period drama.
fresh	There's at least one better film on the topic - Gallipoli - but The Water Diviner has its moments, even if its grasp of reality is all wet.
rotten	The film requires a historical complexity that eludes Crowe, who flattens the landscape into bromides on family and country, and the hard-won glories of being Russell Crowe.
fresh	Crowe shows great skill in staging scenes. He finds the right pacing to get the most out of the scenes without letting them become contrived.
rotten	This is truly a story about the wounds that wars leave even on those who don't fight in them -- and all the lengths to which Crowe will go to convince you that strong men also cry, sir. Strong men also cry.
rotten	The film leaves you feeling as though you've watched a movie thrice its running time. Crowe, the director, knows what he wants... and what he wants, apparently, is everything. It's too much.
fresh	Some formulaic elements creep into the story but it's anchored by the grim realities of the first modern war and a sweeping humanism reminiscent of Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion.
fresh	The Water Diviner brims with ambition and gorgeous digital camera work.
fresh	A sentimental period tale...schmaltzy but generally agreeable in a determinedly old-fashioned way.
rotten	It's three, maybe four movies smashed gruesomely into each other, as though Crowe was afraid he'd never direct again.
rotten	Crowe is effectively restrained in his acting, but in his debut as a director, he overdoes the manipulative music and the pretty images from cinematographer Andrew Lesnie.
fresh	While the film is not in masterpiece territory, Crowe's aims are stirring, his point of view is confident, and his directing skill with his co-stars is firm.
rotten	"The Water Diviner" just wants to tell an old-fashioned war story, but it might have picked the wrong war.
fresh	Seen through Crowe's beauty-seeking if exoticizing camera, the Turkey-set period epic asks difficult and urgent questions about war and masculinity
fresh	The movie is beautifully shot and Crowe is adept at filming war action and the camaraderie that forms even among former enemies.
fresh	Crowe is not messing around here, not trying to dream up opportunities to throw himself another close-up. He's a genuine director.
fresh	Russell Crowe delivers -- as actor and director -- in sweeping WWI-era drama.
rotten	"The Water Diviner" begins to feel less organic than catered from an ordering menu of movie cliches.
fresh	The Water Diviner is a promising debut. Russell Crowe probably has many years left before he delivers his tour de force, but at least he's given us a tour worth attending.
fresh	The feature directorial debut of Russell Crowe, who also stars, it tells a compelling tale of loss and reconciliation, and does so with evenhanded sympathy for the adversaries on both sides of the conflict.
rotten	While it's exciting that my watch learned to talk and yelled "Stop looking at me!" that doesn't excuse the two-hour incompetence festival that is The Water Diviner.
rotten	Crowe is a commanding lead actor who could have made it into something special if he'd stayed out of his own way. Maybe he should have stayed home. You should.
rotten	Its emotional thrust ... is made limp by indiscriminate direction and the kind of quantity-over-quality mindset that invites tacked-on romances and dream sequences that play like dream-sequence parodies.
rotten	The pseudo-mystical elements never quite connect with Crowe's old-fashioned, melodramatic storytelling, especially the cheesy romance.
rotten	Crowe and his writing team milk the tragedy, lather the romance on with a spatula and even throw in some adventure, presumably because they got bored.
fresh	Crowe makes the most of his own quiet presence, and this ode to the world's never-recovered soldiers and their families is a fitting meditation on the insanity of war.
fresh	Beautifully directed and entertaining, but the history is problematic.
rotten	As a director, Mr. Crowe's camera meanders all over the place; as an actor, he mumbles and growls his way through the carnage like it was nothing more important than a re-make of Gladiator, filmed on old sets from Gene Autry westerns.
rotten	Russell Crowe proves to be a proficient director in need of better material with The Water Diviner, an adaptation of Andrew Anastasios and Dr. Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios's inspired-by-true-events novel.
fresh	Stately, old-fashioned and sentimental...and historically revisionist.
fresh	Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in this overly ambitious yet still slim historical romantic drama.
fresh	War is hell and love is difficult in this epic-style, old-fashioned Hollywood movie.
rotten	A surprising number of technical mistakes for a major film released by a studio.
fresh	Russell Crowe's directing debut is an entertaining albeit flawed drama-adventure set in the aftermath of one of the most infamous battles of World War I.
rotten	The Water Diviner comes up dry.
rotten	In straining for the profound, the film ultimately loses its way in a veritable no-man's land of ill-conceived stylistic choices and narrative switchbacks.
fresh	The curiously-titled film is both a realistic war drama and a mystical fairy tale, and the styles don't always marry perfectly.
fresh	If [Crowe's] performance wasn't as strong as it is then The Water Diviner simply wouldn't work at all and it would be harder to forgive some of his less impressive directorial judgements.
fresh	Russell Crowe makes an entertaining debut as director.
fresh	When director Crowe sticks to historical adventure, his film is tense and exciting. But it lacks a sense of magic that it needs to make it fully engaging.
fresh	Russell Crowe's directorial debut proves an odd mix of war-is-hell realism and slushy romance. It doesn't always work but is at least handled with sincerity.
fresh	The romance feels a bit tacked on but Crowe clearly knows how to direct a battle scene.
rotten	While the heartless Brit caricatures may be an accepted genre staple, the smouldering cultural exchanges between a fiftysomething Oz farmer and a winsome Turkish hotelier push this from old-fashioned melodrama into modern-day mush.
rotten	This handsome, earnest bit of piffle not only stars Russell Crowe but marks his directing debut.
rotten	Sometimes it works but more often it just feels corny and obvious.
fresh	Russell Crowe makes a sure-footed if unadventurous debut as director with this tale ...
fresh	Russell Crowe's directorial debut is a solid, old-fashioned piece of film-making set in Australia and Turkey during the First World War and its aftermath that is guilty of some strange historical oversights.
rotten	Russell Crowe's first effort as a director provides four movies for the price of one.
rotten	This is a sugary drama, in which Crowe's big emotional moment looks as if some assistant director applied a trickling tear to his cheek with an eyedropper.
fresh	If you are in search of national mythologies on the grandest scale, nothing will beat the scene in which Russell takes on a small army with just a cricket bat.
rotten	Sadly, it's only the ludicrous moments that really stay with you.
fresh	For his directing debut, Russell Crowe tells a story so compelling that it almost obscures the rather clunky filmmaking...
fresh	[Crowe] has taken some easy shortcuts, but his future in directing looks bright as the Anatolian sunrise.
fresh	Crowe mounts the story in square, gruffly emotive fashion, but his best achievement is wrestling with a truculent, famously thin-skinned leading man, and extracting the most soulful performance he's given in years.
rotten	The story is remarkable and profound, however the way the tale has been presented and told is too cliched, devaluing the poignancy attached to this narrative.
fresh	It has sincerity, sensitivity and is often ravishing to look at but is let down by a chocolate box love story. Still, Crowe still might have a Braveheart/Dances With Wolves in him yet.
fresh	Making his first shot at feature direction, Russell Crowe homes in on a key trauma in Aussie history and brings it vividly to life.
fresh	A sombre, intelligent tale of readjustment and personal healing.
fresh	Russell Crowe shows his squishy side as the director-star of this soft-hearted war melodrama.
fresh	The moving message of The Water Diviner is humane and, thankfully, not delivered with a hamfist. Given the formidable list of great directors Crowe had worked with, Ron Howard appears to be the one who has had the most influence on his emerging style.
fresh	Crowe's directorial debut is a call for tolerance and understanding, pacifism and reason, and, above all else, compassion ... for everyone affected by every war.
fresh	If you have temporarily given up on Australian-made cinema, the engrossing family drama The Water Diviner might just change your mind for the better.
fresh	This is a beautifully shot, intelligently directed film that, as with former soldier Stephen Daisley's award-winning 2010 novel Traitor, shows us another side of the Gallipoli story.
rotten	While The Water Diviner is well meaning to a fault and features moments of brilliance, star and director Russell Crowe just cannot boost his passion project through the sludge of liberal guilt that consumes the film whole.
fresh	The strength of Russell Crowe's directorial debut is its entirely inglorious depiction of the ANZAC experience.
rotten	Despite my interest, there are several elements to The Water Diviner that left me puzzled. Embedded throughout the film is a layer of "spirituality" that borders on science fiction.
fresh	"The movie's not without its problems, but it's hard to fault its reverent determination to look beyond the jingoism of the Anzac Legend, to make salient points about reconciliation"
rotten	The Water Diviner is an awkward beast, one that's too large and unwieldy for intimate drama, yet too small for the enormous frame that it hopes to fill.
rotten	The romanticism and sentiment take hold; repetitions and flashbacks crowd in, along with slow-motion camera effects that no-one really needs.
fresh	It's all anchored, however, by the quiet strength of Crowe's performance and there are plenty of moments which remind you of the power cinema can exert when emotion and spectacle are in sync.
fresh	The Water Diviner is not the masterpiece we were hoping for, or the one the Australian film industry needed, but Russell Crowe's directorial debut shows promise.
fresh	The Water Diviner is one father's crusade for peace as he wades through the devastation of war. Mr. Crowe has done an accomplished job of revisiting Gallipoli, with an open heart.
fresh	This quiet determination (of an important private objective) is well managed in the screenplay and in Crowe's direction and performance, serving as the film's emotional and moral backbone
fresh	The strength of the film is its personal nature and Crowe convincingly embodies a man whose decency and love of family, propels him on a soul-searching journey of discovery in search of redemption
fresh	Making his directorial debut with the brawny and big-hearted Australian war drama The Water Diviner, Russell Crowe taps a deep well of symbolism, cultural empathy and good old-fashioned storytelling.
fresh	An often capriciously mixed cocktail of war film and cross-cultural family melodrama, "The Water Diviner" marks an ambitious if emotionally manipulative directing debut for Russell Crowe.
fresh	It's a solid and engrossing adventure with some humour and an unlikely love interest, a fast-moving quest with a touch of Indiana Jones and a pinch of Lawrence of Arabia.
fresh	A postcard war melodrama illuminated by beautiful colours and sunshine-through-leaves lighting.
fresh	It reminds me a little of Woody Allen in that it's using comedy to make insightful comments about relationships and society.
rotten	There's a lot on the mind of this satirical look at middle-aged angst, but the film's lack of depth make its overall impact more muddled than profound.
fresh	A routine middle-age-crazy sitcom for over-educated urbanites.
fresh	While We're Young is a smart, observational comedy on the millennial iteration of the generation gap. It might have been more entertaining if you didn't feel the urge to strangle the hero.
fresh	Josh wants Jamie's life, Jamie wants Josh's status. Each generation suspects the next, but in their division Baumbach has made his most pleasing and accessible film yet.
rotten	Much like Baumbauch's filmography, it's frustratingly uneven. Razor sharp at times, but mostly scattered and unclear, out to comment on a generational divide without much of a game plan to guide the feature.
fresh	While We're Young is a rare experience -- it vaulted over my dire preconceptions.
fresh	While We're Young isn't Noah Baumbach's greatest film. It's more like a collection of his greatest hits.
fresh	Perhaps not [Baumbach's] best film, but his easiest to embrace.
fresh	A well-etched social comedy with clear viewpoints about the elastic nature of integrity and compromise.
fresh	The film asks thought-provoking questions about modern technology, friendship and even documentaries that will likely cause deep discussions afterward.
fresh	Broader and significantly funnier than any Baumbach project yet.
rotten	I wondered if writer-director Noah Baumbach couldn't decide about his own project, because he switches gears dramatically midway. I responded more strongly to the film he started to make than the one he ended with.
fresh	While Stiller's Josh may be worried about losing his edge, Baumbach should have no such fears.
fresh	Baumbach has a great sense of the ridiculous, and a sensitive instinct for keeping the attack under control.
fresh	Questions of identity abound in "Young."
fresh	A great film about modern generational relationships still needs to be made. But until such a movie comes along, the entertaining and occasionally insightful While We're Young does its part to help fill in the (generation) gap.
rotten	...very little feels organic about the film, starting with Stiller and Watts as the central couple.
fresh	Will youth triumph over the seasoning of age, or will experience trump innocence? Such time-honoured questions are folded into a cunning script.
rotten	While We're Young tries to be a lot of things, but ultimately the story left me frustrated. Like the characters, I left the film wishing about what could have been.
fresh	A great performance by Ben Stiller makes this an easygoing Sunday afternoon movie, if not one of Baumbach's best pieces of self-examination.
fresh	Throughout this peculiar and hilarious film, the answers to Baumbach's questions are found in ideologies and political rhetoric, which he believes people subscribe to in their relationships.
fresh	A human comedy of people growing up and growing older, finding out who they are and what they want out of life, and learning that every age--and every stage--has its joys as well as its jolts.
fresh	While We're Young is the Antz to Bad Neighbours' A Bug's Life, and not just because Adam Driver looks like a giant grasshopper.
rotten	I suspect the extravagant praise lavished on Noah Baumbach's films comes from those who can relate to the dreary, doleful misery of snarky, neurotic New Yorkers.
fresh	Fedoras, vomit, and laughs. Just when should you have your mid-life crisis?
fresh	The obvious shots at hipster scenes...eventually sour into a complex critique of modern ambition in a changing cultural landscape.
fresh	The best parts of this movie come from Baumbach finding inspiration in the way the younger generation works, particularly in the hipster movement.
fresh	The wonderful thing about While We're Young and the relationship that develops between Josh and Cornelia and Jamie and Darby is that it's less about resentment than it is a celebration of romantic love. At least initially.
fresh	Baumbach knows we're all wondering if we're on the right life track, and While We're Young once again shows that he understands how funny that wondering can be.
rotten	While We're Young may provide the fusion of two disparate narrative packages but the glass is only half-full.
fresh	A smart charmer of a comedy that feels as personal as it does universal -- at least for those coming to grips with the fact that they now require reading glasses.
fresh	The first two-thirds of the movie are absolutely delightful, but once the gears of the arguably too clever plot begin to grind, 'While We're Young' loses some of its appeal.
fresh	"While We're Young" is clever and sharp, but it's also uncommonly generous for a Baumbach film towards all its characters. That kindness must be a byproduct of getting older.
fresh	Baumbach, whose films include the searingly funny, autobiographical The Squid and the Whale and the brilliantly uncomfortable Margot at the Wedding, writes wry, sharp, poignant stuff.
fresh	Baumbach has more fun struggling with the deeper questions than he's ever had before, and the result is an open-hearted, quick-witted take on old problems in new times.
fresh	Baumbach plays with universal themes about the uncertainty of aging, the elusive nature of "cool" and the acceptance that comes with settling down ...
fresh	Yes, both characters have some major, character-defining flaws, but Baumbach observes the two men with unexpected sympathy.
fresh	When "Young" is good, it is delicious, playing on 40-somethings' resistance to being considered "middle-aged."
rotten	For a while much of this contemporary comedy is great fun - until the party ends and you're ready for these people to go home.
fresh	Sharp editing, a masterful attention to pace and wonderful performances.
rotten	While We're Young starts off as an empathetic, funny look at middle age and winds up as profound and schematic as a Neil Simon play - or, for the younger set, an episode of The New Girl.
fresh	Only an artist at the midpoint between the maypole and maturity could concoct a comedy as potent as "While We're Young."
fresh	A sometimes poignant paean to struggling to age gracefully while time drags you kicking and screaming to the inevitable end, While We're Young effectively balances wry comedy and bittersweet drama.
fresh	The result isn't entirely riotous, yet Baumbach weaves in plenty of droll observations about the bittersweet burden of middle age.
fresh	Isn't as sharp or consistent as 'Greenberg,' Baumbach's previous collaboration with Ben Stiller, but while uneven, its high points outnumber the low ones.
fresh	Makes for a fantastically entertaining character study, even if you'd flee from these characters on the street. Look at these hipsters.
fresh	Has a few missteps -- perhaps part of its quality -- that are hard to brush aside. Even so, it is a great film -- the first such of 2015.
rotten	Baumbach has a solid grasp of what it feels like to hit one of those life transition points but a far more tenuous sense of the hip milieu occupied by the younger characters.
fresh	A sharp satire about the middle-aged fear of youth.
fresh	While We're Young is easily Baumbach's finest, most understanding film yet.
fresh	It still has an edge, but it's tempered with experience. Like his frequent collaborator Wes Anderson, Baumbach seems to be reaping the rewards of having grown up.
fresh	Baumbach is as perceptive as there is when it comes to the way people talk and act, achieving an acute level of realism, even in a comedy as wonderfully absurd as this one.
fresh	For about an hour, "While We're Young" was one of the most exhilarating times I've had at the movies in many a month. It played like razor-sharp Woody Allen in his prime.
fresh	Much of the film's humour is mined from its satirising of Jamie and Darby's retro-hipster lifestyle.
fresh	The film has [Baumbach's] usual strengths: sharp urban insights, brainy comedy, moments of inspired high exasperation. It also shares a few of his faults.
fresh	One of the pleasures of an intermittently very funny film is its sly and subtle approach toward the attrition between generations.
fresh	It's a funny thing, the generation gap. Depending where you are standing, it can look like anything from a hairline fracture to an unbridgeable chasm. From Noah Baumbach's point of view, there's plenty of comic mileage at either end of the spectrum.
fresh	It's a rueful look at what those in their mid-twenties and mid-forties have to offer each other and what the cultural differences are between those whose time it is now and those whose time it was 20 years ago.
fresh	Witty, observant, salty comedy about work, love, babies.
fresh	The film has its intellectual airs but it delivers witty one-liners, belly laughs and physical comedy.
fresh	If you've been wishing you could see a good Woody Allen comedy again, you should check out Noah Baumbach's While We're Young, which sees the 45-year-old director moving in on Allen's territory - the Manhattan comedy of manners.
fresh	Baumbach has always tackled tough stuff, the universal truths of growing up, growing older and confronting oneself, but I usually found his take on it to be overly precious. Until now, that is.
fresh	Funny and wise, it's got to be a front-runner for best comedy of the year.
fresh	The dynamic between Stiller and Watts, especially, is strong: he is tightly wound and neurotic, while she is much looser. It's Watts' best work for a while.
fresh	Highly recommended for anyone feeling wistful about their youth.
fresh	There are so many deserving targets skewered by Noah Baumbach's savvy Ben Stiller comedy While We're Young, you could lose count.
rotten	Noah Baumbach is still swinging away at generational divides and the plight of the artist, but here, he trades in his rapier for a foam rubber cudgel.
fresh	Both young and old will find a lot to laugh at in this film, which has Baumbach's frothiest dialog and shrewdest characterizations.
fresh	Baumbach may be the sharpest social satirist of his generation - in some ways, he's a Woody Allen with clearer vision and fewer nervous tics - but the message of this droll, enjoyable bourgeois vaudeville can be boiled down to Father Knows Best.
fresh	While We're Young pairs two New York couples, one middle-aged and anxious and the other millennial and carefree. Both are in for a satirical skewering, but also - and here's a change for Baumbach - something close to a hug.
fresh	A smart, empathetic, sometimes scarily identifiable work from a writer-director who continues to carve a gratifying niche for himself in independent cinema.
fresh	The storytelling is smooth and assured and the one-liners are generally enjoyable.
fresh	Heartbreaking and cautiously funny,
rotten	Struggles as it weaves anachronistic 'Look! Hipsters ride bikes! And watch video tapes!' commentary.
fresh	A new, endlessly confusing generation gap is just one of the subjects skewered in the brilliant new comedy from Noah Baumbach.
fresh	A lot to digest in a single viewing, but feels unmistakably like another vital work from an ever-maturing filmmaker.
fresh	Even at its most confected, this is a film that tells the truth.
fresh	Baumbach belongs in a select group of invaluable American directors. He makes movies built, increasingly, like traditionally structured studio comedies of an earlier age.
fresh	It's a satire of endless youth, "The Kids Are All Right" colliding with "My Generation." Yet it's the best kind of grown-up absurdism.
fresh	A sharp look at getting older, growing up and assuming responsibility.
fresh	Baumbach has produced another excruciatingly pleasurable and wince-inducing study in insecurity.
fresh	Writer-director Noah Baumbach once again taps into a specific point in life with astute observational skill, even if the plot feels oddly forced...
fresh	A triumphant examination of confusing efforts to figure out what to do with yourself as a human of any age.
fresh	This stinging GenX midlife meltdown is a bit strained in its plot, but that's balanced out by lots of melancholy wisdom and bittersweet wit.
rotten	"While We're Young" is one step forward and two steps back for writer-director Noah Baumbach, whose movies are never less than intelligent but, at their worst, tend to settle for gestures instead of movements.
fresh	There are no definite heroes or villains here-just shifting values that reward the good old human vanity in a new, locally-grown/artisanal/organic (insert your own buzz word here) way.
fresh	A middle-aged couple who are stuck-in-a-rut in their marriage and work yearn to build a richer and deeper life together in love.
fresh	Baumbach does a rich, comic job with the contrasts between the couples, capturing both middle-aged lightheadedness and callow youth with a simmer of sociological precision.
fresh	A cross-generational character comedy whose biggest problem is its characters, Noah Baumbach's While We're Young is sharply observed but frustratingly slight.
rotten	"While We're Young" is a movie that recedes while you're watching it.
fresh	The best Woody Allen film of 2015. A fast, funny, smart take on generational jealousy, with Ben Stiller and Adam Driver on great form.
fresh	This is sharp filmmaking, treating serious themes with a beguiling lightness.
fresh	A knotty exploration of the dialectic between sincerity and authenticity, or the shifting relationship between truth and fiction in an age where we're no longer sure what those words mean ...
fresh	Some of its sillier tangents don't always hit, but when fully firing, its barbed one-liners are often spectacular
fresh	Comes together in a way that's surprising and fulfilling.
fresh	While We're Young might be Baumbach's most playful and loose film yet. For a film about the differences between three generations of documentary filmmakers--an art form not known for the LOLs, that sets up a lot of LOLs here--that's a surprise.
fresh	While We're Young may very well turn out to be Baumbach's magnum opus.
fresh	This is advertised as a comedy, but...what it really is, is the story of idealism facing up to the real world in the movie industry. Terrific performances, well directed, great script...the ending is surprising but in touch with the real world.
fresh	In filmmaker Baumbach's contemporary comedy, Stiller and Watts never lose sight of their connection with each other even while examining their life choices.
fresh	While "Greenberg" had pointed observations to make about a middle aged egotist and his relationship with the younger generation and his own past, this one is muddied by unclear intent and sketchily defined female characters.
fresh	Might have been a simple takedown of the Millennial generation - you know: "These damn kids today." But the movie is more complex than that.
fresh	The observant and mocking humor that makes the film's first two-thirds so breezy and enjoyable gives way to shattering realizations, but Baumbach ultimately tempers that instinct somewhat by exhibiting genuine sympathy for Stiller's character.
rotten	'While We're Young' plays like a screenplay that was several drafts away from hitting its target.
fresh	When Baumbach is on, he's really on, and the brilliant "While We're Young" contains the same self-lacerating humor as his "Greenberg," "Margot at the Wedding" and "The Squid and the Whale."
fresh	Fear is a major theme of While We're Young, seriously explored even when played for laughs.
fresh	I have some problems with this movie, not all of which can be ascribed to the usual narcissism of small differences. But first it's important to acknowledge the acuity of Mr. Baumbach's insight and his overall generosity of spirit.
fresh	Baumbach, in what's easily his most conventional and commercial film, gives the film a fun rhythm and fills it with some legitimately good gags. The film is less wise than it thinks, though.
fresh	This delicious satire about aging hipsters and their discontents is everything we've come to expect from the best of Noah Baumbach, as well as several things more.
rotten	it's too heavy a load for this slight chassis to bear
fresh	A sharply observed and witty dark comedy.
fresh	Noah Baumbach's best movie since 2005's The Squid and the Whale, While We're Young navigates into more mainstream territory while losing none of the writer-director's rueful wit.
rotten	Putting one's finger on exactly what's wrong with "While We're Young" is a challenge. Best to use several fingers.
fresh	The verbal wit and comic set-ups are smart and sprung from the zeitgeist.
rotten	While We're Young is hurt more by its weak plot and resolution than anything else.
fresh	There's a certain breezy obviousness to much of the humor: it's like a broad, sitcom expansion of a Moral Tale or a Comedies and Proverbs episode that Baumbach's beloved Eric Rohmer might have made on a sortie to Williamsburg.
fresh	As usual, Baumbach's writing is alert to the lies people tell themselves to avoid combusting spontaneously in a flaming ball of self-loathing.
fresh	While We're Young is perhaps [Noah Baumbach]'s most unpleasant picture to date, and that's a compliment.
fresh	Funny and smart, finding humor in cultural pretension without taking cheap shots. That's a lot harder than it sounds.
fresh	"While We're Young" is snarky, smart and surprising, right up until the final shot.
fresh	Stiller's scenes with the gifted Adam Driver escalate into generational comic warfare of a high order. Baumbach touches a raw nerve.
fresh	One of Noah Baumbach's more accessible films, with solid performances all around.
rotten	Only the motives of Baumbach's alter ego are pure. Meanwhile, the most entertaining questions - Can people transcend wide age gaps? Should they want to? - turn out to be beside the point.
fresh	It's not Stiller's character who's the curmudgeon, it's Baumbach.
fresh	Baumbach's most conventional comedy turns out to be his most fully realized film -- sharp, polished, nicely pitched and played.
fresh	In terms of the effectiveness of its scare tactics and the precision of the one-liners, 'While We're Young' is uncut Baumbach.
fresh	Noah Baumbach's latest is a comedy of cross-generational exchange that's smart, lively, and beautifully observed-until it sours in a final act that undoes much of what precedes it.
rotten	Another inconsequential Noah Baumbach parody of so-called "normal" people trying to function in a fractional society changing too rapidly to keep up with, While We're Young is a dreary bummer.
fresh	Baumbach's confidently charming latest, plays more like a Woody Allen-ish parody than any of his other movies, but the shift hasn't required a sacrifice in insight, heart or bite.
fresh	Baumbach's eighth feature isn't just sharp, it's serrated - its jokes, and there are lots of them, come at you with rows and rows of tiny teeth.
fresh	Sharply observed, often LOL comedy about artistic integrity and the shrinking horizons of middle age.
rotten	Noah Baumbach lobs jokes with hectic editing and a Sturgesian velocity, but much of this cross-generational comedy is frantic and wearisomely superficial.
fresh	It shows a director not so much mooning over the past, with regret for faded powers, as probing his own obsessions and the limits of his style.
fresh	A classy comedy about the generation gap and the ubiquity of manipulation.
fresh	While We're Young subverts and exploits the audience's desire to find heroes and villains in its narrative. Millennials merge with Generation X and emerge conflicted, but enlightened.
fresh	Beneath the onslaught of contemporary in-jokes and one bad fedora, Baumbach manages to articulate, with a great deal of poignancy, the timeless challenge of aging
fresh	Perceptive, funny and cringingly honest ...
rotten	Ben Stiller does what he does yet again in a familiar story of a middle aged couple invigorated by youthful friends set in the borough of Noah Baumbach.
rotten	A decaffinated and sitcomish approach to a boulevard comedy of early middle-age behavior
fresh	If Frances Ha was Baumbach's very successful attempt at remembering the excitement and uncertainty of his younger years, then his new film is a witty report on where he is now -- or, at least, the people he sees around him.
fresh	Noah Baumbach's new Ben Stiller-lead comedy has big laughs and thoughtful commentary for anyone who's thought the phrase, "when I was young."
fresh	A strong mainstream effort by director Noah Baumbach. Ben Stiller hasn't been this funny in years.
fresh	Brooklyn-oriented social satire has already worn quite thin... and While We're Young is in danger of thinning out as well. But the Baumbach touch... goes a long way to smoothing out the film's more canned moments.
fresh	Intellectually supercharged entertainment, with a laugh-line-per-minute count it would be grouchy to undersell.
fresh	Baumbach is never less than shrewd in the way he links his protagonists through insecurity.
rotten	We know from his previous work that Baumbach is capable of writing much more interesting and full-conceived female characters than these, so the gender imbalance here is disappointing.
fresh	The breezy tone of the early stages deepens into something more profound by the film's conclusion.
fresh	Baumbach's own acutely observed this-is-life laffer features his most relatable characters yet.
fresh	[Baumbach's] best, and funniest, in a decade.
fresh	While a truly original comedy, "While We're Young" is the rare film that laces rich thematic elements with wonderfully drawn characters to create a picture that's as genuinely hilarious as it is thoughtful.
fresh	While We're Young is a mostly enjoyable movie, but what it's trying for is wisdom, and that's a quality that Baumbach doesn't earn.
fresh	The most hilarious Woody Allen film in years is directed by Noah Baumbach, with Ben Stiller as basically an updated version of the idealistic documentary filmmaker the Woodman played in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors.'
fresh	Justin Long and Johnny Depp join the "Clerks" director for a weird, unpredictable movie that still feels like only Smith could have made it.
fresh	A film with performances much better than its material
fresh	... offers a compelling glimpse into the convergence of journalism and the justice system.
fresh	True Story covers a lot of ground quickly ... leaving plenty of room to explore the film's complex themes.
fresh	Begins better than it ends, with tantalizing details that suggest a more satisfying tale than is actually in store.
fresh	When the truth of the story at last sinks in, it's not decorous at all -- which is to the credit of Rupert Goold and True Story.
fresh	We can admire the concept, but we're happy when it's over.
rotten	What's the opposite of stealing a movie? Putting it back? Looking the other way? Laziness? Whatever it is, that's where I am with James Franco.
fresh	Gripping, disturbing drama based on real murders.
rotten	Though [True Story] attempts to tackle issues of reportorial and moral integrity -- just how far someone will go to convince him or herself that the end justifies the means -- it is ultimately totally out of its depth.
fresh	Ripped from the headlines, it is not as good as "Capote," but close enough.
rotten	Biggest crime is underusing its best actor. Felicity Jones gets stuck in a cliched dutiful wife trope.
rotten	Finkel comes off as a generic viewer surrogate, which is a problem when the viewer is ahead of him.
fresh	With True Story, the very definition of "true crime" itself is put under the microscope, as Jonah Hill and James Franco both play against type and play against one another.
rotten	Where to begin in tabulating the missteps in this uninvolving, mechanically plotted mystery. We don't buy Hill for a second as a globe-trotting reporter; Franco's accused killer is all twinkly-eyed smirks.
rotten	Filming a drama about the compromises and conventions of storytelling, Goold falls prey to them. He lacks the pulp verve and the symbolic imagination to illuminate or even convey the characters' mysteries.
rotten	A crime drama posing as a mystery.
fresh	It's not in the same league as "Capote" or the recent "Jinx," but still earns its place in the pantheon of journalists cozying up with mass murderers.
fresh	'True Story' is about how far a person can bend the truth before it breaks and how devastating it can be when it finally gives way.
rotten	Franco often comes across more as a guy peeved that someone tapped out the frat-house keg than a tortured individual potentially engaged in Machiavellian maneuverings.
fresh	Goold never allows the script or actors to make light of the relationship --- or its importance.
fresh	Hill and Franco did not rehearse their scenes together beyond the first table read, all the better to make their interaction more natural and plausible. It worked.
rotten	A story with potential that's done in by Hill, who is not up to the task of portraying such a complex character.
rotten	Jonah Hill stars in a drama that's no laughing matter. Even though the film grows muddled in trails of misdirected ambition and deceit, Hill excels.
fresh	It's as good as any work I've seen in a film in 2015, and "True Story" is one of the better movies to come along this year.
rotten	Slow pacing on top of subdued performances and a misappropriation of the film's focus turns us into the real victims of this film.
rotten	One of the creepiest disclosures in this rather weird movie comes at the very end, when we discover how a couple of the featured players are getting along now.
fresh	'True Story' reminds us to take anything we view with a grain a salt and a sneer of incredulous while truly appreciating those who do not lie...
fresh	Attention, true crime addicts desperate for a new fix after Serial and The Jinx: This riveting and highly disturbing chiller will satiate your needs.
rotten	...never developed any sympathy for the two key players.
fresh	This type of wallow in ethical murk isn't always exciting, but it's heady and deep.
fresh	Director Rupert Goold keeps things appropriately creepy, but True Story is no Capote.
fresh	True Story digs deeper into the cultural fascination with killers and attempts a potent corrective along the way, reminding us who's been lost but also how justice isn't just another gripping procedural.
rotten	This is a movie about two men facing off on a playing field of ego and hubris. The last thing it needed was a couple of star turns.
rotten	Slow moving and never delivers on "Why?"
rotten	This is a strange story to tell and an even stranger way of telling it, and worst of all, it's puts us in position to root for the redemption of a character who doesn't deserve it and shouldn't have it.
rotten	Director Rupert Goold obviously had Truman Capote and In Cold Blood in mind while making True Story, and it pops into our heads, too, but the comparison isn't always a good thing.
fresh	Methodically paced, and anchored by two damned solid performances from Jonah Hill and James Franco.
fresh	A bizarre and at times downright creepy story that functions well as a good yarn but also for its exploration of the often-blurred boundary between truth and fiction.
fresh	An okay if underwhelming 100 or so minutes where the only real question and related drama is whether the accused is guilty or not. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Longo's character remains not just opaque, but uninteresting, while Finkel's gets endless, useless attention. As fascinating as he may have been to himself, the movie never conveys that appeal to us.
rotten	As refreshing as it is not to see a comic book, slam-banger movie this close to summer releases, the talky 'True Story' could use some movement. Adapting it as a stage play seems more plausible.
rotten	A cat-and-mouse murder tale in which the mouse is a self-destructive sap and the cat has been declawed.
fresh	Uneven but Franco's creepy charm is compelling.
rotten	You could easily imagine Hill and Franco in a parody version, with Franco, like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, crossing and uncrossing his legs to each probing question.
rotten	Jones delivers her moral righteousness with a passion the rest of the film lacks. Otherwise, this is just the story of an awful human and the dupe who loved him.
fresh	True Story fascinates beyond the initial hook of the story...
fresh	Does a lot of its work with its tongue-in-cheek title, a meta commentary on the not-so-broad spectrum of liar, actor, fiction writer, filmmaker and journalist.
rotten	There's a fascinating true story at the heart of True Story, but somehow the process of putting it on film has smoothed out the horror and smothered the inherent allure in the tale of a disgraced journalist who befriends an accused murderer.
rotten	Never mind the facts. True Story, slick and shaky, doesn't know where the truth lies.
rotten	Unfortunately this "Story" never finds its footing as either a creepy morality play or a performance-driven two-hander.
rotten	The drama has a wicked premise and some memorable one-on-one scenes, but it leads nowhere.
fresh	To watch "True Story" is to think, "Wait, this insane thing really happened, right?" But, sadly, it is also to think, "Boy, do these two deserve each other."
rotten	Leads with its chin from the title on down and which turns a startling tale of true crime and false identities into a heavy-breathing drama that, ironically, fails to convince.
fresh	This is chilling material, and Hill and Franco make sure the story packs a wallop.
rotten	There is plenty of potential for turns and twists, but nothing ever happens.
rotten	The real story of Christian Longo and Michael Finkel might be a fascinating and disturbing tale of crime, curiosity and journalistic ethics, but that's not what this movie is.
rotten	"True Story" rings false from start to finish.
rotten	Lightweight script doesn't help a grandiose premise.
rotten	not enough of a promise to power the entire film
fresh	The script is first-rate, questioning whether any story can really be credible when both the writer and the subject have everything to gain from it.
fresh	Watching these two actors (and off-screen best buds) feed off each other becomes the big draw in British theater director Rupert Goold's interesting but ultimately underwhelming movie debut.
fresh	True Story is more like watching a chess match between expert players than attending a soccer match that erupts in a crowd riot.
fresh	A fact-based but slow-paced legal thriller notable more for its cast than its narrative momentum.
fresh	Franco is finely cast as the manipulative murderer-his heavy-lidded eyes and half-smirk can be menacing given the right material.
rotten	Even with shrewd and honest work by Franco and Hill and a solid supporting turn from under-used Felicity Jones as Finkel's romantic partner, the film comes to life only sporadically.
fresh	While the movie sometimes seems like faux Fincher, the symbiotic acting, artful imagery and punchline ending turn "True Story" into credible entertainment.
fresh	True Story is an intrinsically fascinating and occasionally riveting tale marred by unnecessary embellishments.
rotten	Viewers aren't left with queasy questions about truth, credulousness and culpability as much as with a downcast shrug.
fresh	[An] intermittently fascinating movie version from first-time features director Rupert Goold and stars Jonah Hill and James Franco in roles that, for once, don't ask them to be caricatures of arrested adolescence.
rotten	If we figure out Franco-as-Longo is lying before Hill-as-Finkel does, then why should we be interested in this writer's redemption if he's so easily hornswoggled?
rotten	Every so often you will look at Franco and think what a fine job of acting he's doing. But you'll think that even as you are not believing a moment of it.
fresh	By film's end, True Story is less about the evil of which people are capable than the way we manipulate and act, sometimes unconsciously, in order to get what we want.
fresh	The film is pretty standard fare that, considering the crazy-but-true nature of the story, deserved something a little more memorable than this.
rotten	Maybe the point is we never know who or what to believe. But too many maybes are hell on sustaining tension.
rotten	A dry, flat production. Neither convincing nor dramatic.
rotten	"True Story" spends much of its 90 minutes trying to figure out just what it is.
fresh	"True Story" introduces itself as a tale of murder, but it's special work when dissecting the death of integrity.
fresh	A chilling tale about the price of lying.
rotten	Frequently bounces back and forth between something that lives up to its name and something that inspires skepticism and disbelief.
rotten	There's no tension and never a moment where it feels like anything is at stake. Longo is guilty; Finkel will get his story and get on with his life. It's all about them, not what happened to an innocent family.
rotten	This based-on-fact drama would seem to have enough lurid details, slippery truths and human complexity to be an intriguing combination of "Capote" and "Shattered Glass." But the movie squanders its chances.
fresh	Like Serial and The Jinx, it draws some fascination from the distinct possibility that the suspect it studies may be guilty as charged.
fresh	Even if the treatment of the story can be a bit lifeless, the facts themselves are so fascinating that the movie can't help but be compelling.
fresh	Franco downplays his accused killer role, speaking softly and dazedly, which works eerily well. Hill makes Finkel driven and obsessed, yet never heroic.
rotten	We should suffer along with the unsteady Finkel as he gets drawn into Longo's world, but too often, his anxieties remain exclusively his own.
rotten	In Cold Blood -- or even Capote -- this is not. It's made with too much slickness, and you'll be way ahead of it.
fresh	Although True Story never comes close to Truman's Capote's In Cold Blood standard for true crime, its willingness to shed the procedural approach allows it to transcend the mediocrity that often infects tales of this sort.
rotten	In the four years since he was Oscar-nominated for "127 Hours'' - and disastrously co-hosted the Academy Awards ceremony - James Franco has gone from one of our most exciting actors to an international joke.
fresh	That the main characters are played by James Franco and Jonah Hill makes it more interesting - a good thing because most of the story is two guys sitting around talking. You'll be glad it's them.
rotten	Goold has made a stolid, well-acted, intelligent drama that respects the complications of Finkel and Longo's storytelling agendas without bringing them to life.
rotten	True Story trips and stumbles so much in the telling that you don't know what to believe, and instead of one man's irony you end up with two men's lies.
fresh	Hill and Franco are well-cast, but the meant-to-be-more-suspenseful film? "Capote Lite."
rotten	Pat and thin, swelling up like a balloon in its middle section before shrinking to a nub by its end.
fresh	The limitations of its script and of Jonah Hill's performance in the central role keep it from transcending its shortcomings.
rotten	The balance between true-crime cable soap and the darker, richer layers of Franco's performance never quite adds up.
rotten	The filmmakers follow the lead of a true story into a thicket of snarled motivations, confusing situations and tepid confrontations that yield little actual conflict.
rotten	Especially for a movie that springs from a horrific and grisly crime, True Story feels undershaped and indistinct; it's too dispassionate to be genuinely chilly.
rotten	If the film's copycat visual artistry illuminates nothing, at least its script is sincerely devoted to probing Finkel and Longo's odd partnership.
rotten	A story this strange and intriguing could have used more juice. Ultimately, True Story is as frosty and aloof as the enigmatic Christian Longo.
rotten	True Story is involving but surprisingly calm, going for stretches without seeming to care whether what he's reporting is an expose or a cover-up.
rotten	A very dry legal procedural.
fresh	The chemistry between Jonah Hill and James Franco banks on their friendly comfortability, but this immediate bond makes for a tense, jarring tension that emerges from two tragically destined characters.
fresh	Clever exploration of a cat-and-mouse theme featuring the exploitation of a journalist by a convicted murderer.
fresh	Understated in spite of its sensational subject matter, it's a well-made if somewhat humdrum movie.
fresh	A riveting and rigorous examination of lying.
fresh	An incredibly frustrating film where only supporting player Felicity Jones truly shines.
rotten	When more ambitious films indict a lie, the entertainment defense wins every case, but True Story falls short.
rotten	The film makes a show of judging its subject, Mike Finkel, even while taking his story at face value and paying him for the privilege. It's bogus moralizing piled atop more bogus moralizing. Great acting though!
rotten	Lack of subtlety downgrades True Story into a crumpled piece of questionable non-fiction.
fresh	An offbeat crime drama that compels right from the start and will have audiences talking.
fresh	Such a strong piece that I would not even be remotely surprised if this is being talked about at year's end, come awards time.
fresh	A strong showcase for Jonah Hill's dramatic chops.
fresh	"True Story" doesn't seem to fully capture what's fascinating about the material.
fresh	The important themes below the surface come out in impressionistic waves. The actual story, with its occasionally cringe-worthy, on-the-nose dialogue, comes very close to exposing the entire production as a lie.
fresh	"True Story" is a tightly made slice of true crime that treads the line between fact and fiction that has so bedeviled storytellers, and asserts that perhaps reality lies somewhere outside of that, and is still only what you make of it.
fresh	In Goold's hands, the two thesps deliver measured, soul-searching work.
fresh	The film is not only stylized, but it is also about style. From the multipurpose suits and accessories to the deadly prosthetic legs, there is an elegance behind it all.
fresh	If you too like action films with lots of flipping and gunplay, then probably you're going to greatly enjoy yourself.
fresh	The leads are good, and there's enough zip in the script, and Vaughan's direction, to hold the interest.
fresh	A punk rock rebel of a movie. It follows no rules. It slaps you in the face while making you laugh. Completely entertaining, it also isn't afraid. In our environment of careful and slavish correctness to groupthink, that feels like a refreshing breeze.
fresh	A rousing dose of retro-fueled fun, replete with sharply dressed secret agents, hi-tech gadgets, lethal henchmen (er, henchwomen), and, of course, a diabolical villain with a secluded mountain-top stronghold.
rotten	However far-fetched and theatrical Kingsman: The Secret Service may be, it's a tepid throwback.
fresh	One of the most smartly-crafted action films of recent years... [but] it has some grim, grim thoughts about human beings and society.
fresh	A celebration of the lost art of political incorrectness.
fresh	A veritable Dinstuhl's of scrumptious eye candy, but with a premise that is a throwback fantasy to an era of white-supremacist colonialist world oversight: The Kingsman 'knights' are living symbols of superior Anglo civilization, and they know best.
fresh	A smarter spoof than Austin Powers, and free of the over-seriousness of the Bond movies, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a much-needed fresh take on spy fiction.
fresh	Imagine a Roger Moore James Bond with the potty mouth of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and the action from The Raid.
fresh	Watching Kingsman: The Secret Service made me think of Casino Royale. Both of them. The silly first one with David Niven playing 007, and Daniel Craig's rebooted, bare-knuckle Bond. One spy romp nothing like the other, nor a particularly good match.
fresh	On Day One of filming, they must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one "Wait, what?!" moment after another.
rotten	Firth does a good job as the proper English spy and looks like he's having a good time. Sadly I couldn't say the same.
fresh	At its heart, Kingsman is just as much a parody of James Bond and his spy genre cousins as the Austin Powers franchise.
fresh	It's not a full-on spoof like Austin Powers but Kingsman: The Secret Service is very aware of the cliched world in which it operates.
fresh	'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is an entertaining nod to spy flicks from the 1960s.
fresh	Rowdy, amusing romp - spoofing the James Bond concept of dapper gentlemen involved in international intrigue.
rotten	While the bounteous fight sequences have verve and style, the rest of the film does not.
rotten	Any sense of triumph is purely at the level of stuntcraft. The rest feels less than the sum of the moving parts.
fresh	Camping it up, Jackson is hilarious.
fresh	More often than not, as he keeps the action coming and juggles numerous topics, Vaughn delivers a vibrantly entertaining good time.
fresh	A loving homage to spy movies that stands as a film in its own right, Kingsman draws its influences from all the right places and, most importantly, is entertaining.
fresh	Kingsman: The Secret Service isn't for the politically correct or the faint of heart. But, if you're on its groovy, twisted wavelength, it's a stone blast.
fresh	Move over, James Bond. Some new supercool spy guys--and gals--have just laid claim to the multiplex, and they make just about everything that came before them look old, slow, tame and even lazy.
fresh	In a million years, nobody watching The King's Speech could've imagined that one day the Oscar winner would clean house in a house of worship armed with a bulletproof umbrella. But he just did. Somewhere, Tarantino is kicking himself.
fresh	has a solid sense of fun
fresh	Cheeky, rude, stylized, stylish, in crashingly bad taste and with something to offend absolutely everyone. In short, check it out.
fresh	Perfect. And a massacre worth seeing.
fresh	Occasionally director Matthew Vaughn likes to show us just how crazy-violent his imagination can get, and not every frame of those scenes is necessary but it's a small price to pay for such pure escapist entertainment as this.
fresh	"Kingsman" is not for the faint of heart and features some intense violenece, but it's delightful tone makes even the most sinister of acts feel like they can be avenged with a smile.
fresh	The set pieces manage to be both bold and old. A bloody shoot-out set in a Kentucky church, however, is just cold.
fresh	Surprisingly entertaining.
fresh	The fight scenes are very well staged in this film. The acting is solid in all the main characters, which are fleshed out better than are the characters in most spy movies.
fresh	As you'd expect from Matthew Vaughn, the purveyor of the scintillating superhero sendup "Kick-Ass," the experience is adrenaline-pumping to the point of overload.
fresh	A fun, imaginative and highly entertaining adventure. But, then, in my book, any film with Colin Firth is a winner!
fresh	The body count is so high the only thing missing is Uma Thurman.
fresh	The picture cannily works on two fronts, not only operating as a bona fide throwback flick but also subverting the genre in imaginative ways.
fresh	...an entertaining thriller/spoof of the James Bond genre...marred by too graphic violence but abetted by fine performances and wry humor.
fresh	Frequently reactionary, bordering on retrograde, bordering on reprobate. But it's also a tremendous amount of fun.
fresh	While much of Kingsman is an entertaining spy romp, Vaughn overindulges in some lengthy killing sprees that diminish the overall power of his film.
fresh	All about fun, playfully riffing on the James Bond movies while establishing a stylish, over-the-top formula of its own and tackling the issue of class.
fresh	Based on a comic book, Kingsman occasionally betrays its roots but Vaughn has adapted it to fit his unique approach.
fresh	I had no idea how much I wanted to see Colin Firth kick butts and shoot people in the head until I saw him do it.
fresh	Smart genre riffs and hyper-stylized action, Kingsman: The Secret Service manages to provide a clever twist on the spy movie format.
rotten	I don't use the word "reprehensible" a lot, but that's what this movie becomes after a promising start.
fresh	The core story unfolds predictably, but, like the Kingsmen themselves, with style.
fresh	Kingsman: The Secret Service politely and eloquently clobbers you with undeniable wit, frantic yet unflinching action, and extremely adult but uproarious humor.
fresh	Only one complaint. Why the heavy language? The R-rating keeps teens who'd also enjoy this really fun spy romp from enjoying the fun without mom and dad tagging along.
fresh	This movie is a whole lot of fun, especially to be treasured by movie nerds (references galore) and action aficionados (a few of the sequences, while not revolutionary, will still leave you breathless).
fresh	In the age of the overserious spy film (see: Daniel Craig's Bond, the Jason Bourne series, etc.), this is exactly the bold, silly kick up the ass that the genre needed.
rotten	The second half of "Kingsman" is a wipe-out of epic proportions, with Vaughn and Millar losing their sense of structure to whip up a painfully familiar frenzy.
rotten	If the movie had kept up this kind of pace and tone for the rest of the way, I would have been a fan.
fresh	Jones-ing for a Bond movie?
fresh	Brash, witty spy film is packed with over-the-top violence.
rotten	The second half of the movie becomes a loud, f-bombing cliche of excessive violence.
rotten	Doubles down on glib ultraviolence while pressing buttons of class-consciousness and teasing out pop-culture allusions and self-aware witticisms. But this time, the postmodernism feels played out.
rotten	...combined with an inane villain master plan and a third-act turn into large-scale gratuitous brutality, the thing becomes a tonal mess.
fresh	Not for every taste, but this spy spoof has some kick
fresh	Entertaining enough, but if you're going to keep referencing James Bond, shouldn't you actually have something to say *about* Bond? It lacks a satirical edge and there isn't nearly enough sex.
fresh	What makes "Kingsman" so entertaining is that it is totally aware of what it is doing, giving you a nudge to inform you know that, yes, we are letting you in on the joke as well.
rotten	It sounds fun in theory, I guess, and there are some entertaining moments of rude irreverence here and there but the giddiness gets a bit tedious after a while.
fresh	Kingsman is not a film for gentlemen. It's for us, the great unwashed, bloodthirsty audience. It's an immaculately engineered, laugh-out-loud appeal to our own depravity.
rotten	Vaughn is expert at eyeball-knifing action, but he's so invested in its execution that he can't seem to let it go, and it runs on and on.
fresh	Firth participates in the bulk of the fisticuffs, and seeing the British actor - best known for playing a role in which his chief antagonist was a speech impediment - lay the smack down is a hoot.
fresh	I'm not saying I'm proud to have enjoyed a movie in which a dapper Colin Firth kills about a hundred people while the guitar solo from "Freebird" plays on the soundtrack. I'm just saying I did.
fresh	If you don't take it seriously for one instant and don't mind the hard-R content, you'll have a blast. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Style to spare? Sure. Bond-like flourishes? Yup. Yet Kingsman crumbles under the weight of its own ultra-violence.
rotten	It relishes low-class ugliness.
fresh	Kingsman: The Secret Service is a lively, dashing and amusing motion picture that smartly spoofs and slyly celebrates the James Bond spy-film franchise.
rotten	The film tries so hard to be a clever, deconstructive meta-tale, forever winking at the audience about its silly story, that it metas itself into insignificance.
fresh	Director Matthew Vaughn brings his unique sensibilities and breathes a breath of fresh air to the stagnate Spy Genre. You can't go wrong with Samuel Jackson as a mean mugging, villain who speaks with an hysterically bad lisp.
fresh	From start to finish, Kingsman is cartoonish -- or maybe graphic-novelish -- in the absolute best way possible, thanks to its inventive mix of action.
fresh	It's not necessarily trying to reinvent Bond, so much as reminding us that there are other games in town. And they can be just as enjoyable to play.
rotten	The violence is intense (I'd go so far as to call it appalling), even by Bond standards.
rotten	A near-miss...it runs down in the second half and its dark turn proves overly jarring.
fresh	A film that began with a confident sense of sophistication, wit, and edge knows what it is not ("This is not that kind of movie") but not what it is.
rotten	[A] movie that can't quite seem to decide if it wants to come across as superior to the perceived silliness of its inspiration or if it just wants to go with the silly flow.
rotten	The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn't use violence; he squanders it.
fresh	"Kingsman: The Secret Service" holds many surprises: all inventive, some comical, most intentionally silly, a few horrifically and gratuitously violent.
rotten	Ultimately, there's little to care about in Kingsman, a spy film that's all dressed up with no place to go.
fresh	It's hugely enjoyable.
rotten	Enjoys its basest fantasies without even acknowledging that they're base. A wink or a nudge indicating some glimmer of maturity could turn the third act into a masterpiece of rebellion, but it's all bravado.
fresh	"Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a youth-quaking riff bursting with affection for vintage 007 action and urbanity, yet one that feels wholly organic in the way it goes about selling this appreciation to a younger crowd.
fresh	If you can forgive the failings for at least some of the two-plus-hour running time, "Kingsman" serves up its share of entertaining froth.
rotten	The main reason Kingsman: The Secret Service leaves you feeling rooked is that it wastes a once-in-an-actor's-lifetime opportunity.
fresh	Kingsman ... keeps finding new ways to surprise with well-trodden territory.
rotten	Vaughn packs the frames with eye-popping detail, and there's an infectious creative energy to his violent action sequences, but the film's hatefulness is hard to stomach.
rotten	For all Vaughn's attention to stylized details, I noticed a number of obvious continuity errors throughout to which Vaughn seems blind.
fresh	Kingsman has a spastic verve that turns what could otherwise be gratuitous and rude into an act of spunky bravado, like it's making good on a dare. I'm surprised they got away with some of it.
fresh	Vaughn has transformed the original comic book story into one with enough sharp edges that this could be the next big spy series. To accomplish that task, it will take a little more consistency with the future films.
fresh	The joyously silly and ultraviolent black comedy Kingsman: The Secret Service captures the spirit of 1960s Cold War spy movies.
fresh	achieves its goal in spite of itself
fresh	There's enough action, suspense and all-around fun to make Kingsman: The Secret Service an unexpectedly enjoyable ride.
fresh	The less you try to make sense of "Kingsman: The Secret Service," the more you'll enjoy this freewheeling, preposterously violent action comedy from the creators of "Kick-Ass."
rotten	This absurdist mashup of spy-movie genres-especially those with gentleman spies-points up the frenzied pace of change with a frenzy of its own, then runs low on comic resources in the process.
fresh	Like the rookie who knows that you have to make a few mistakes while following the master, the movie shrugs off its missteps with a wink and a smile that makes them easy to forgive.
rotten	The mix of comedy and corpses in "Kingsman" becomes callous and clueless - in addition to seeming about 50 years behind the times.
fresh	It could be tighter but it's lots of fun.
fresh	Things go from far-fetched to insane before it's over, and Vaughn wisely keeps the pace at a healthy clip. But never underestimate his power to floor you.
fresh	In spite of a few questionable tonal shifts and a spare misstep here and there, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" makes a name for itself because of its buoyant, frequently bawdy sense of fun.
rotten	Does "Kingsman: The Secret Service" have a secret right-wing agenda? I couldn't get that thought out of my mind while watching this visually taxing and noisy spy spoof.
fresh	Heads roll. And explode, en masse. Bodies are bisected. Vaughn is the sort of fellow who feels that if he hasn't taken things too far, he hasn't gone far enough.
rotten	"Kingsman" is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It's ridiculously out of balance, and when you're stuck in the middle, it doesn't seem so funny.
fresh	A stylized superspy caper stretching a selection of high-profile actors to roles satirically against type.
fresh	Its blend of breathless action with Brit irreverence is like James Bond skipping the martinis and lacing a proper cup of tea with crack.
rotten	This is world-class action filmmaking at the service of a smug, soulless story.
fresh	A brazen, subversive send-up of 007, Kingsman: The Secret Service also has the high-octane excitement to work as a spy film on its own merits.
fresh	Simultaneous spoof, homage, one-upping, and debasement of James Bond, delivered with gory, self-conscious glee by the inimitable Matthew Vaughn.
fresh	Those of limited imagination will likely complain 'Kingsman' is cribbing from the 007 franchise. But it's really subverting it at every turn.
fresh	Prepare for one of the most fun nights you're destined to have at the movies this year.
fresh	The film never entirely figures out what it wants to do with the myth of the superspy, but at least it has fun along the way.
fresh	A gonzo-fun take-off on old-school super-spy yarns. Smashing!
rotten	I will say this: "Kingsman" has some nerve, however misguided.
fresh	Will make you forget all about that stuffy James Bond flick coming later this year.
rotten	Director Matthew Vaughn's latest film, Kingsman: The Secret Service, is an attempt at finding a balance somewhere between Austin Powers and James Bond that doesn't quite succeed.
fresh	Vaughn finds new ways to deconstruct and reconstruct the spy-thriller... blends Hong Kong action with state-of-the-art digital effects to create breathless set pieces.
rotten	Starts a little cheeky but gradually becomes the entire butt, first figuratively, then literally. (Don't ask.)
fresh	"Kingsman: The Secret Service" wears its influences on Colin Firth's immaculately tailored sleeve. It winks and nudges and points, and if you still don't get it, it spells them out.
fresh	Slick entertainment, provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext.
fresh	A cleverly constructed homage to the Bond pictures, particularly the early ones starring Sean Connery, before everything got so deadly serious in the Daniel Craig era.
rotten	Kingsman feels like it should be a good time, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste.
fresh	Caught between straight-up James Bond and the Austin Powers parody version, Kingsman is a high-octane combo of action and comedy that breathes surreal new life into the big-screen spy game where Bond meets Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer.
rotten	The violence flies repellently over the top, and the finale features an extended joke so insanely sexist it sends us out on a seriously sour note.
rotten	Borrows the tone, story, characters and humor of "Kick-Ass," only this time in a 007 world instead of Batman's. Nearly everything it does, it does poorly: This one is "Weak-Ass."
fresh	Kingsman is entertaining in its way and occasionally clever, but also relentlessly smug and sexist.
fresh	If you're not averse to ridiculous violence and un-PC irreverence, your money will be well spent.
rotten	Expensive, derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric ...
fresh	The crazier Matthew Vaughn's homage to James Bond becomes, the greater it is.
fresh	Pure fanboy ecstasy- a muscle-flexing spectacle of cartoon violence and cheeky attitude, which announces its cleverness at every turn.
rotten	Austin Powers without the laughs, a bloodier Bond without the sophistication, or gravitas
fresh	The secret sauce for Kingsman: The Secret Service may be just common ingredients, but it's still makes for quite a treat.
fresh	Everything in Kingsman is familiar, cribbed from James Bond and a thousand other sources, yet every setup gets twisted twice, and then once more, just when you think you're ahead of it.
fresh	When Kingsman is truly on target and proceedings appear to be gleefully spiralling out of control, the energy expended and electricity generated can take your breath away.
rotten	It's structured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders.
fresh	There is an assumption that over-the-top spy movies wouldn't work in 2015. Kingsman proves they can.
rotten	[VIDEO ESSAY] Matthew Vaughn is no Quentin Tarantino.
fresh	The biggest kick in Kingsman: The Secret Service is watching 54-year-old Colin Firth, heretofore the epitome of British refinement onscreen, bust a move.
fresh	It's a movie for teenage boys if there ever was one, which is to say it's also powerfully sexless, right up to an ending that would titillate only a 14-year-old.
fresh	Countless viewers will relish the brazen zest of its invention.
fresh	A nostalgic homage to 007 that's also the most mesmerizing movie of the year thus far.
fresh	A ludicrous guilty pleasure.
fresh	If the movie weren't so dependent on the gravitas of its adult leads and so resoundingly impoverished without them, then the prospect of sequels would be enough to awaken anyone's inner teen.
fresh	Kingsman: The Secret Service takes Bond's vodka martini and adds a shot of adrenaline to the mix.
fresh	In the same way Shaun of the Dead became an almost perfect zombie movie simply by sending up the genre, Kingsman just might have done Bond better than Bond.
fresh	Joining the long, long list of James Bond spoofs comes yet one more in the well-dressed, blandly titled, way-too-long form of Kingsman: The Secret Service... Jam your brain into neutral and you should enjoy most of the over-long shenanigans here.
fresh	A beguiling mash-up of the spy movie genre with a seamless blend of action, satire and spoof, Matthew Vaughn's envelope-pushing film offers hip, lip and zip
fresh	Vaughn shoots the film with the giddiness of a 12-year-old, one who just stepped out of his very first spy movie with dreams of saving the world.
fresh	While very familiar, [the story] is also so very fun and alive in its telling that it's impossible to resist its charms.
fresh	A cheeky James Bond pastiche that fizzes with tongue-in-cheek humour and larky ultra-violence.
fresh	For the most part it's brash, boisterous fare, cocking unsubtle snooks at its generic predecessors ...
rotten	I cannot recall a film that left me with such a sour taste in my mouth by its end. Does the movie deliberately defy itself with obnoxious intent?
rotten	It is ridiculously entertaining in parts but let down by a yawn of a plot and some fairly cheap looking effects work.
fresh	To accuse the director of glorifying violence ... would be to miss the point: what fascinates him isn't strength but the porous border between righteous anger and pathology.
fresh	Gentleman spying was never so much fun.
rotten	For those weary few of us who harbour an allergy to Vaughn's deliberately obnoxious style, each movie feels like an insult - one added to a heap of computer-generated injuries.
fresh	Although it begins as a predictable 007 spoof, Kingsman: The Secret Service soon finds its own groove. Director Vaughan has a licence to thrill and does so with some exhilarating action sequences.
fresh	For the most part, it is uproarious fun.
fresh	Light-hearted, fast-moving entertainment is the name of the game, with Firth a quite excellent action hero.
fresh	There is so much going on that whenever one scene falls flat, something livelier and more effective soon follows.
rotten	Admittedly, the film has a thorough knowledge of its forebears and though it namechecks them at every opportunity, Kingsman brings very little that's new or valuable to the playing table.
rotten	[Vaughan's] latest picture, a genre mash-up that sends the Sixties-era Bond-style gentleman spy on a collision course with the supporting cast of Kidulthood, is his most gratuitous slaughterfest yet.
rotten	Though competently acted and lushly upholstered, this childish film is let down by bold-type irony: so bludgeoning that it ceases to merit the description.
rotten	It is a film forever demanding to be congratulated on how "stylish" it is.
fresh	Perhaps the riskiest mainstream movie in years, Vaughn's love letter to spy movies may be uneven in places, but it's ultra-violent, envelope-pushing, and fun enough to overcome the flaws. Bond with the stabilisers taken off.
fresh	Matthew Vaughn is the anti-national treasure British cinema has been crying out for.
fresh	Fox may have a new franchise on its hands with this witty and occasionally spectacular homage to 1970's-era James Bond adventures.
rotten	An ugly film dressed up in a cheap suit, the flaccid Kingsman is less biting, transgressive Bond tribute, and more akin to a gorier, swearier Stormbreaker.
fresh	Kingsman is an unashamedly entertaining spy movie that'd likely raise Roger Moore's eyebrow into the stratosphere.
fresh	One of the most ridiculously entertaining spy flicks since Roger Moore hung up his safari suit.
fresh	Vaughn's direction is slick and stylish throughout and he orchestrates a number of dazzlingly audacious, thrillingly violent set-pieces that are both shocking and hilarious.
fresh	An unashamedly and unrelentingly enjoyable piece makes for immensely entertaining cinema.
fresh	'Kingsman' is undoubtedly worth the ticket price. Just try not to think too much...
fresh	Kingsman is a hugely enjoyable, super-styled, ultra-violent fantasia, pushing all those starchy, toff values that underlie Bond into absurdity but then making them work all over again.
fresh	A delicious blend of streetwise savvy and old-fashioned espionage motifs.
fresh	With contempo audience's infatuation with all things superheroes and comic book movies, and the baseline treatment of humanity in such movies, Kingsman: The Secret Service arrives at just the right time.
fresh	Vaughn and his collaborators have taken a crude and disposable property and turned it into something more - a thoughtful, exciting, whip-smart spy adventure that doesn't let its smart-ass post-modernism overwhelm its playfulness or its heart.
fresh	Injecting fun and fairground thrills back into the spy movie, Kingsman is a blast. Firth is sensational, Jackson rules and newcomer Egerton surprises.
fresh	Maintains the snarkiness of Mark Millar's writing, while creating something on a much grander scale.
fresh	This movie is so alive that few will roll their eyes at the message - one that says a true gentleman's virtue comes from within, and not their accent.
fresh	Firth enters new territory with style and grace, anchoring a smart, high-energy movie that eventually runs out of steam.
fresh	Whether it's "Alex Rider," "Agent Cody Banks" or "Spy Kids," plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults.
fresh	A startlingly enjoyable and well-made action film leavened by humor and slicked along by style, made by, for, and about people who've seen far too many Bond films.
fresh	
rotten	It often feels like a whole lot of episodes strung together.
fresh	A wall-to-wall delight peppered with gags for adults, Spongebob 2 absolutely holds up to a second viewing.
fresh	Bonkers laugh... like a colourful, senses-pounding rush. The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water offers far more craziness than David Hasselhoff could in the first film.
fresh	An animated Monty Python movie you can take the whole family to.
fresh	The live-action sequences, in which Antonio Banderas chews the pirate scenery, may not live up to the Looney Tunes madness of the cartoons, but for sheer head-scrambling craziness this is hard to beat.
rotten	The prolonged live-action sequence is great fun, but ends too quickly. It seems like a lost opportunity.
fresh	Intermittently, SpongeBob's latest feature is very funny indeed, even for non-devotees of the original series.
fresh	Sponge Out of Water has a frenetic, Looney Tunes pacing and a head-spinning, surreal story that makes you wonder whether it's aimed at children or stoners.
fresh	Absurdity abounds in this odyssey of groan-worthy punning, new ways of defying cartoon physics, epic food fights, trippy time-travel, and superhero sendups.
fresh	SpongeBob SquarePants has always been aimed much more at childish adults than actual children, and this deranged comical adventure is no exception...
fresh	Under the expert guidance of TV series writer/director Paul Tibbitt, sophisticated adult gags jostle with inspired childish silliness, each element dovetailing for increased inventiveness.
fresh	Almost every line is a zinger, which can be appreciated in a state of total sobriety: it's a non-stoner stoner film - and very funny.
fresh	The film moves like a pyjama case full of angry weasels, and finds ingenious ways to cram every scene with just one more loopy, disposable gag or slapstick thwack. It may not be the year's best animated film, but it's almost certainly the most.
fresh	There's a streak of madness running through The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, elevating it above the usual run-of-the-mill animated fare into something that, at its best, is inspired lunacy.
fresh	In praise of teamwork, this second SpongeBob movie in 3D with its combo of adorable animated characters and integrated live action is bright, amusing, clever, naive and hugely inventive
fresh	It's a simple premise with proven appeal, giving director Paul Tibbitt and his team freedom to construct a film where just about every element of the storytelling exists to be parodied and undermined.
fresh	What it delivers is what it promises: a battery of deliciously daft, fast-firing, self-mocking, flavour-rich gags, flung with such zest you don't mind if they're disposable.
fresh	For the most part, Sponge Out of Water provides decent-sized doses of wacky animated fun; it's packed full of hilarious one-liners, pop culture references and colourful characters that should keep both adults and kids entertained.
fresh	A film of rare ambition in family filmmaking, the obvious result of passion and care.
fresh	Psychedelic, colorful and in-your-face, you'll want to soak up the latest from Spongebob.
fresh	I never know what I want from commercial animated entertainment, but I do know that I like being able to suspect that -- by the standards of the competition -- its makers might be outlaws and lunatics.
fresh	The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water finds a reason to come off the TV and onto the movie screen. More than fifteen years since his debut, he feels fresh once again.
rotten	Why a movie about an unassuming cartoon sponge felt compelled to adopt the register of a summer blockbuster is beyond me.
fresh	It's tough to hold a lack of narrative ambition against any 'toon so eager to lob bit after bit of psychedelic surrealism at its audience, be they wee tykes or stoned adults.
fresh	Business as usual for the irrepressibly cheerful, pineapple-dwelling sea-creature.
rotten	A nominal theme&mdash;complete with theme song&mdash;of teamwork. But really, Sponge Out of Water is about little more than fast food and ice cream, with the same promise of empty calories.
fresh	Silly, surreal and squeezable, SpongeBob scores again.
fresh	Laugh out loud funny, visually engaging, and entertaining for anyone of any age, Sponge Out of Water proves that Spongebob has plenty left in the tank and is bound to allow us to visit his pineapple under the sea for many years to come.
fresh	...a labor of love by all involved and for those that have been with the franchise since it made its first appearance on the Nickelodeon channel way back in 1999.
rotten	While the sequences outside the ocean will attract the most attention, the most endearing segments are those that keep the characters bumbling and bickering close to home.
fresh	Ask A Five-Year Old: Q: What was your favorite part? A: When SpongeBob pulled down Patrick's pants.
fresh	The SpongeBob Movie is essentially a kid-friendly stoner comedy, but also one that's clever and inspired enough to keep SpongeBob fans entertained.
fresh	This is not just a good SpongeBob movie - it is a genuinely great use of cinema as a visual medium, funny as hell and utterly random in its dream-logic
fresh	Sometimes, certain kids' movies are so flat-out weird that they eventually become cult classics for viewers who take pleasure in not being able to quite believe what they're seeing.
rotten	To the many devoted followers of SpongeBob and his underwater friends, this may come off as snobbish, or even sacrilegious, but, unlike many animated characters, I found nothing remotely funny or redeeming about these cartoon denizens.
rotten	But after a few minutes, the movie abruptly switches to full animation, and rather primitive animation, at that. You could practically hear the collective sigh of the audience.
fresh	Fun, goofy SpongeBob movie is as trippy as the show.
fresh	It's big, loud, choppy, in-your-face, and absolutely, positively glorious.
fresh	Not the most gripping narrative, but the frenetic pace and nonstop gags will please young fans.
fresh	An exercise in fun. There's no deeper meaning to it. Just a lot of nautical nonsense thrown at the map by some creative people who are still in love with their creation. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents available)
rotten	Though some parents and older non-parents are into Sponge Bob the concept is really aimed at little ones. A 90-minute film is painful for them - and us - to squirm through.
fresh	"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" remains true to the surrealism of its animated television roots. But it also tries to force a live-action element which isn't as comfortable a fit as a certain pair of symmetrical trousers.
fresh	A funny sequel too slow to get to what the entire audience wants and has been promised.
fresh	Even childless (and sober) I still had a pretty good time, and if you like silliness with a sprinkling of surrealism, you will too.
fresh	The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water mostly nails what has always made the character, and his brightly coloured underwater world, so endearing: the abundant innocence, the welcome lack of cynicism and the out-and-out stupidity.
fresh	While less fluid and fresh than its 2004 predecessor, the new film displays enough nutty writing and sheer brio to confirm the stamina of its enduring and skillfully voiced characters.
fresh	Teamwork is the theme here, but the SpongeBob team wouldn't dream of preaching, instead pushing imaginations to their limits.
fresh	Deliriously silly story, tender-hearted and cheery.
fresh	For my part, it's the most laughs I've had at a theatre this year.
fresh	The bulk of Sponge Out of Water stays submerged, hand-drawn and Banderas-free, still delivering the coy wit, surrealism and absurdity that come hand-in-hand with SpongeBob's frivolous, childish whimsy.
fresh	All of the strangely charming cartoony undersea nonsense of SpongeBob that's delighted kids and stoners for year comes to the surface in "The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water." Prepare to giggle.
rotten	Maybe we shouldn't have expected too much from "The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water."
fresh	A goofy gag-filled surf-and-turf romp that will entertain adults with its ridiculous lunacy as it delights kids with colourful fun.
fresh	This animated movie isn't about anything, really, so don't look for morals or thematic undercurrents. But even at its most mundane, it's still pretty trippy.
fresh	clearly enjoys the times when it can push the boundaries of its 15 year old idea and bring a new perspective to the participants and their problems
rotten	There's something about this project that, despite checking all of the requisite plot and sensibility boxes, doesn't convey as an organic work of SpongeBob-ishness.
rotten	Even kids will smell something phony about the repeated cheers of "Teamwork!" And any grown-up who thinks the obvious puns are somehow clever or subversive has been smoking seaweed.
rotten	You can tell the script is short on punch lines by how often it resorts to poop and fart jokes, the last refuge of the desperate gag writer.
rotten	[The film] runs a reasonable-sounding 92 minutes. Yet those 92 feel like more than enough.
fresh	The film strives to be weird as often as funny. But it's such a good-natured kind of weird that the viewer can't help but succumb to this barrage of 'nautical nonsense.'
fresh	A breezy, colorful, giddily zany return trip to Bikini Bottom.
rotten	Children may be delighted, and perhaps also addled.
fresh	"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water" weaves a silly - and often funny - spell. It's a scrappy little B-movie that zips along rather entertainingly.
fresh	The spirit of the series remains true: cheerfully random jokes, blink-and-you'll-miss-them references and, above all, a silly, stubbornly sentimental streak that only the crabbiest cynic could dismiss.
rotten	While the outcome is intermittently funny, it's also watered-down and hyperactive.
fresh	Director Paul Tibbitt takes all of the visual humor and presents it in both sparkling traditional animation and stunning computer-generated sequences for dry land.
fresh	The story is just a pretext for sustained, rapid-fire gags, many of them hysterical, that range from movie parodies to Gary Larson-worthy flights of cartoon weirdness.
fresh	It's amiable goofiness, delivered at an emphatic, feverish pitch.
fresh	The plot is straightforward, predictable and slight, no more intricate a plot than a 15-minute TV episode would have. It's the freewheeling madness of its execution that makes the movie such a trip - as in acid trip.
rotten	Nothing new or exciting for Spongebob fans. It's even more painful if you're not a fan.
fresh	There's no heartfelt, overarching message here-even teamwork, as much as it's mentioned, doesn't seem to stick with anyone-but that doesn't detract from the fun.
fresh	This megadose of Spongeyness is laugh-out-loud funny. A lot.
fresh	It's consistent fun, with the franchise showing little sign of fatigue. Perhaps a hesitance to sequelize is present, but once the film gets rolling, it's hard to recall the decade-long distance since the last animated extravaganza.
fresh	Ultimately, for the show's fans, it may not matter if "Sponge Out of Water" shows a hint of mildew.
fresh	If you like the yellow guy on TV, you should have a good, squishy time here, too.
rotten	Although moments of playful wit abound throughout, Sponge Out of Water is often so nosily frenetic, it verges on being assaultive.
fresh	['SpongeBob'] really is the 'Three Stooges' of the modern day (albeit less violent and with more good vibes), where the jokes don't have to be great (and especially don't have to be sophisticated) but just have to keep coming.
fresh	Not remotely original, but loopy and small-fry friendly.
fresh	Its dedication to the transgressive power of frivolity remains the franchise's greatest weapon.
fresh	It may not be be the smartest animated flick out there, but with all the wildly weird happenings, and impressive 3D effects being flung out at you, it is absolutely entertaining. Simply put, SpongeBob rocks!
rotten	Eight-year-old me probably would have found SpongeBob's antics vastly more entertaining, but alas, I now need my seagull poop jokes coupled with something more substantial.
fresh	This is primarily an exercise in hyperactivity meant to spark glee in kids and draw chuckles from adults. The effect is admittedly ephemeral, yet while the film is running it is altogether effective.
rotten	While it has plenty of zany moments, SpongeBob's second feature outing proves less absorbing than the first.
fresh	Preserves the sweet, surreal charm of the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon series and adds a bit of novelty by mixing some 3D live action in with its 3D animation.
fresh	At times there's a genuine sense of daring to the film's freewheeling anarchy, its refusal to stick to a central theme or impart any sort of lesson.
fresh	You certainly don't have to be a fan of the show to find yourself enchanted by the goofball humor.
fresh	
fresh	The film bogs down in its contrived narrative framework about a journey of self-discovery, but succeeds more on a character level. Much of the credit goes to the talented ensemble.
fresh	Cast elevates sometimes-edgy story about musician.
fresh	Bright dialogue and great chemistry between Al Pacino and the rest of the cast raise this fairly predictable comedy-drama to very enjoyable entertainment.
fresh	Pacino dials the hoo-ah down, letting his smile and charisma do the heavy lifting. Naturally, it doesn't hurt that all the feeling and healing are accompanied by a soundtrack of Lennon songs.
fresh	Danny Collins has the makings of something terrific, but it doesn't quite reach the heights to which it aspires. It's a catchy and effective film, but one that I fear won't quite make the greatest hits list for Mr. Pacino's remarkable career.
fresh	Al Pacino delivers his best performance in years...it's engaging, captivating entertainment.
fresh	It's become something of a snarky joke about emotionally manipulative entertainment, but when you can honestly say "I laughed, I cried," somebody's doing something right.
rotten	While the cast keep the melodrama limited to a human scale, the screenplay isn't above manipulating us with a cute granddaughter suffering from a learning disability.
fresh	Pacino sinks his gleaming teeth into the role of Danny with a gusto that's charming and infectious.
fresh	Like its title character, the comedy-drama Danny Collins is a movie that starts out overbearing and over-the-top, but slowly grows on you with its quieter charms.
fresh	There's nothing resembling a surprise in this movie, but its simple tune works due to the quality of the performances.
fresh	One of the things that partly excuses the movie's mush is that it's a kind of musical.
fresh	Danny Collins is the cinematic equivalent of a well-sung easy rock tune, enjoyably light and bouncy, with some darker notes hidden within the chords.
fresh	[A] kindly parable from writer and first-time director Dan Fogelman.
fresh	Every scene is played with such authenticity and sincerity that it almost makes you forget the story itself is fiction.
fresh	Pacino's chemistry with Cannavale and Annette Bening overrides the plot contrivances, and he communicates more about his character by just sitting silently next to Cannavale than any long speeches could.
fresh	The superb actors cut through the cliches.
fresh	For his directorial debut, Fogelman puts all the right people together, and what's more, gets a performance out of Pacino that's one of his best-ever comic turns.
fresh	Pacino's exuberance rescues Dan Fogelman's directing debut from the schematic snares in Fogelman's script.
fresh	It's never dull to watch pros like Pacino, Bening, Plummer, Garner and Cannavale interact - this is dream casting - and the film makes the most of that, along with a pleasingly comprehensive Lennon soundtrack.
fresh	A completely charming comedy-drama. Al Pacino is mesmerizing as always, and Bobby Cannavale is the standout in an excellent supporting cast.
fresh	This is a hugely entertaining, mainstream crowd-pleaser about how we can all try to be our better selves, fail spectacularly, then pick ourselves up and try again.
fresh	Scent of a Woman with sight. Playing the last hoo-rah of a fading '70s rock star, Pacino burns the screen as he hasn't in years, not like a flamethrower but the softer heat of a lighter lifted at a concert.
rotten	A committed Pacino and a crack supporting cast can't save a maudlin story about a rock star trying to connect with his estranged son and his better nature.
fresh	Comedy, pathos, and some schmaltzy couplets about the changing seasons follow forthwith.
fresh	Like its hero, the movie is flawed, but hard to resist.
rotten	You might be forgiven for mistaking the film for an extended Holiday Inn commercial.
fresh	The lesson of this likable little movie is that it's never too late to reclaim your integrity.
fresh	Imagine.
fresh	Danny Collins is slightly slight, but it's so competent and sure of itself that it's impossible to dislike. We have entered a new era of Al Pacino.
fresh	Maybe the closest Pacino will ever get to playing himself.
fresh	There's a kind of modest American comedy that's so keenly done that you don't bother resisting. All the details feel exactly right for that particular story and those characters. It just works. Right away, you can tell that Danny Collins is working.
rotten	The film remains a basic case of a cliched story undermining strong performances.
fresh	Danny Collins isn't what it could have been but at very least the actors are terrific and some of the dialogue has a welcome, tart edge.
fresh	Legendary as Al Pacino's skills are, he wouldn't be the first actor I'd cast to play a 70ish pop star who still fills mid-sized arenas some 40 years after he last charted a hit single. Yet Al Pacino sells the heck out of his performance as Danny Collins.
fresh	What Fogelman doesn't quite achieve as screenwriter at the start of the film he makes up for in his directorial debut. He supports wonderfully the affable allure of his attuned cast.
fresh	Al Pacino seems miscast in this piece of showbiz hokum, but he uses his own personal energy to make the role seem alive and likable.
fresh	Danny Collins wisely and surprisingly finds a middle ground for Danny's transformation.
fresh	So shameless is this movie's urge to batter you into laughter and tears that you give in, exhausted and maybe even a little grateful.
rotten	How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Al Pacino, Annette Bening, Christopher Plummer, Bobby Cannavale and Jennifer Garner? This bad, alas.
fresh	There's a nice fluidity and freedom to writer-director Dan Fogelman's storytelling, so things never become predictable.
fresh	While Fogelman's script is extremely calculated and heavy-handed, the cast's nimble execution turns it into an agreeeable way to pass the time.
fresh	You can guess where things are leading, but only to a point. Fogelman tosses in some mild surprises along the way, some more effective than others.
fresh	"Danny Collins," like its central character, has a good heart, and sometimes that's enough.
fresh	There's a delayed-secret hitch in the narrative that hijacks the movie, for better or worse. You don't have to believe any of it to enjoy a lot of it, however.
fresh	While Pacino isn't exactly the most convincing rocker, he's dialed down his propensity to play to the rafters in a performance grounded in humility yet still entertainingly energetic.
fresh	Al Pacino shows a new side of himself - rock star - in Danny Collins and that's something to sing about. He pulls it off and is backed by a terrific cast in this smart and entertainment movie for grownups.
fresh	Dan Fogelman has proven to be an effective scripter and shows maturity in his first time at the helm.
fresh	I love those tunes and could hear them all day; but too often "Danny Collins" commits the sin the star is trying to avoid: relying on someone else's music to get it's point across.
fresh	We know this movie is going to try to pull out our heartstrings, but "Danny Collins" manages to take few unexpected turns, and it makes us want to join it for the entire trip.
rotten	The movie becomes, perhaps inadvertently, a celebration of selling out.
fresh	This likable movie rises or falls on Al Pacino's ability to convince us that he's an aging pop star... and he does.
fresh	Danny Collins' internal crisis, his yearning to make up for the past, is palpably conveyed by the sadness Al Pacino applies behind the extroverted mask.
fresh	An appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode.
fresh	Like the title character, Pacino has found it's never too late to begin anew, and hopefully audiences eager to see him at his best will give Danny Collins a chance.
rotten	Writer-director Dan Fogelman seems as torn as Danny is between his artistic impulses and his hard-wired attraction to bland, audience-friendly material.
fresh	Danny Collins has no intention of breaking new ground. But Pacino and a top cast make it mean something.
fresh	That's what movies are for - to let us see Danny overcome his son's efforts not to give in, all to the tune of some of Lennon's most moving songs.
rotten	[A] shameless piece of boomer bait, which peddles the highly questionable notion that it's never too late to get back to where you once belonged.
fresh	Al Pacino as a jaded, aging rocker re-juiced by a road trip to settle accounts with himself and his long-lost family? By all means roll your eyes - the star has one brow goofily raised himself - but don't give up on Danny Collins.
fresh	A redemption story doesn't always need to show the blood. Danny Collins gets the point across without pretention. Its closing scene, alone, is worth the price of admission.
fresh	Before the action comes a cheerfully coy announcement: "The following is based on a kind of true story a little bit." In fact, the story is not only true, but proves to be a kind of swell idea for a fiction film.
fresh	Though occasionally contrived, in its more low-key, honest moments, Danny Collins rings out with emotional resonance.
rotten	I can imagine a lot of good movies developing from this premise, but as fictionalized by screenwriter Dan Fogelman, it becomes yet another soggy tale of father-son healing.
rotten	If Danny Collins the film did a little more getting down to earth, and a little less hamhandedly reminding you that that's what it was trying to do, it'd really be something to sing about.
fresh	This uneven but ultimately sweet comedy-drama takes full advantage of Pacino's larger-than-life persona (think "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Donnie Brasco," "The Insider") and his ability to add in lovely grace notes.
fresh	A redemption movie in the skeptical key of Jerry Maguire with dozens of small, perfect moments
rotten	When [Annette Bening and Al Pacino] are on screen the film momentarily doesn't seem like a chore.
fresh	The directorial debut of Dan Fogelman, writer of Crazy, Stupid, Love and Last Vegas, the movie combines the compulsive sub-plotting of the former with the retirement-age asides of the latter.
fresh	The best aspect of the film is the music. Both Ryan Adams and Theodore Shapiro deliver a sweet sounding score, as well as a couple of nice tracks.
fresh	Danny Collins breaks away from its Lifetime movie trappings thanks to the way it toys with cliches and a number of touching performances from a cast led by a superb Al Pacino.
rotten	Danny Collins is nothing to write home about, but it kept me entertained without too much guilt, and I didn't wince.
rotten	How could a movie about rock be this tone-deaf? Or this fundamentally false?
rotten	If there's a real person beneath Danny's over-the-top showbiz-lifer persona, Pacino never finds him.
rotten	"Danny Collins'' is certainly watchable, but don't go expecting much in the way of surprises.
fresh	You think you know where this is going, but it's a pleasure to see Dan Fogelman slow down the flow for his two erstwhile Ricky Romas, kicking around life's harsh turns with tenderness.
fresh	The chemistry between Pacino and his cast mates gives this lightly amusing contrivance surprising emotional resonance.
fresh	Will attract Pacino's regular fans and the soap opera crowd as well.
fresh	A cast of old pros (Christopher Plummer, Annette Bening, Bobby Cannavale, Jennifer Garner) and a touching final scene elevate the material just enough to redeem it.
rotten	The symbolism of Danny's self-destruction is so blatant it's aesthetically offensive. The last scene can't even help telegraphing the final minute of the movie, and it has to completely invent something brand new to pull it off.
rotten	The top-notch cast makes this Bleecker Street release almost tolerable, but the spectacle of a dissolute hedonist suddenly acquiring a heart and a conscience late in life is shamelessly, and shamefully, contrived in its emotional trajectory.
fresh	A familiar late-in-life redemption narrative, made surprisingly palatable by Pacino's winning comic bravado, a superb supporting cast, and currents of real feeling that cut through the expected bromides about the emptiness of fortune and fame.
rotten	A sad case of wasted potential.
fresh	For anyone who likes intense drama & great performances
rotten	Drama is well-acted but more political than religious.
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of a Jehovah's Witness who won't take 'no' for an answer getting his foot stuck in your door.
rotten	A deranged melodrama where any sense of soapy, campy fun is undercut by the preachy, self-serious tone.
fresh	Is aimed at a targeted audience of believers and fully satisfies them.
rotten	It's the same old false shuffle dealt from the same old stacked deck.
rotten	"Do you believe?" No.
rotten	A self-aggrandizing sermon that preaches only to the faithful.
rotten	Wherever you fall on the spectrum of spirituality, the only answer to "Do You Believe?" is "No."
rotten	I can't quite sign off on this one because ... well ... the film is really, REALLY hard to trudge through for about an hour and 45 minutes to get to the big climax. (Full Content Review -- listing Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	For most people it will stir a longing for the days when God had a better writing staff: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
rotten	While the message is nice, the screenplay feels like it was written by a third grade Sunday school class.
rotten	As I see more "faith-based" films targeting the evangelical Christian market, I recognise I need to adjust my critical expectations a tad. If it has a coherent three-act narrative, it's already way ahead of the game.
rotten	More professionally produced and acted than the indiegelical norm, but only fitfully engaging on a dramatic level and entirely hermetic on a theological one.
rotten	Subtle as a sledgehammer to the toes and only slightly more entertaining ...
fresh	Juggling so many story lines is a major task, but director Jonathan M. Gunn manages to service all the stories while holding true to the movie's main message.
fresh	Even if the talky result can be frustrating with its deliberate pace, at least it makes for a gorgeous European travelogue.
fresh	Superlative performances are the reason to watch this engrossing, occasionally self-indulgent film that explores the female psyche and responses to age, self-image and changing times within the acting world
fresh	Remarkable and richly layered film examining the thin line between art and life, about change, aging, death and identity, built on splendid performances by Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria is perfectly enigmatic with exceptionally passionate performances from Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart.
fresh	I hereby abandon all pretense: There's no way I'll be able to dig deeply enough into everything that's going on here until I see it at least two more times.
fresh	It meditates long and hard on questions of age, sincerity, celebrity and love, piling irony on irony. And it features a remarkably natural performance by Kristen Stewart that's so unastounding it's astounding.
rotten	Examines the woes of an aging actress
fresh	The nuances of the women's interactions are a splendid thing to observe, and the beauty of these layered conversations makes the general absence of women's unmitigated voices in film more keenly felt than ever.
fresh	Binoche, on whom the camera affectionately lingers, makes herself achingly vulnerable. Though the film feels at times a bit cloudy and enigmatic, it's often fascinating in its juxtapositions.
rotten	Brilliant performances aside, "Clouds of Sils Maria" is overlong and much too self-indulgently an "art film." It might have benefited from being just a bit more grounded.
fresh	What you might not expect is how grounded and strong Stewart's performance is - not words often used to describe her as Bella in the Twilight movies.
fresh	I trust Assayas. After watching Clouds of Sils Maria twice, and taking greater pleasure in it the second time, I'm willing to entertain the possibility that the pomposities he's laid onto the movie might be a warning, to himself as much as the audience.
fresh	Another enigmatic Assayas portrait of women.
rotten	Essentially three different films, and each one in order is a little bit less interesting.
fresh	The clouds could be seen as writer-director Oliver Assayas' metaphor for time, a relentless present that rolls in and wipes away any trace of what was there before.
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria is fiendishly wise to the ways of show business, particularly the boxes in which it places women. But the film offers more than that.
fresh	The big surprise is Stewart, who gives her most grounded performance to date. With her role in this film, she became the first American actress to win a Cesar Award.
fresh	The real star turns out to be the play itself: the early masterpiece of a now-deceased writer, a work of such mirrorlike perfection that it reveals entirely different things to different people.
fresh	It's winding, and it sure takes time and patience, and it's not all that clearly marked. But by the end, you're left with quite a view.
fresh	A probing, illuminating rumination on art versus life, present versus past, and youth versus maturity, all craftily combined to invite reflection as well as admiration.
fresh	Playful and provocative, it's a dazzler.
fresh	Astounding performances by Binoche and Stewart, in a film that keeps the viewer constantly off-balance.
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria invites those willing to wander through the minutiae of the obsessive celebrity artist, and that may well be a barrier to entry for those who might land outside that classification.
rotten	In the end, there's a sense that director Olivier Assayas is more concerned about making a point than telling a story.
fresh	"Clouds of Sils Maria" is such a gorgeous movie --- I could sit through it again and again.
fresh	A beautifully filmed, marvelously acted and totally dialogue-driven movie --- propelled by superlative performances from its three female stars, it is rich with intense characterizations that most movies don't touch.
fresh	Stewart's blazing, blunt, pitch-perfect performance in this film serves as a reminder she's actually one of the best actresses of her generation.
fresh	A shining salute to actresses.
fresh	Thoughful film about aging actress has swearing, racy parts.
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria provides three very good roles for three interesting women, each without spacesuits or superpowers.
rotten	Every layer and point of self-reference serves as a reminder that it's upon the audience to discern significance from the material.
fresh	One watches at a politely admiring, oddly removed distance. The film, exquisitely performed by Binoche, Stewart and Moretz, remains chilly in spite of its showbiz intimacy, which may be the point all along.
fresh	Hugely affecting - and reflective and witty ...
fresh	In addition to the tremendous acting, Assayas's direction has a novel feel, with clever fade-outs reminiscent of theater, which happen just when some bit of action is about to take place. But there are also some curious decisions.
fresh	The film glides and snakes along its path, a path we have trod before in so many other films and plays. But often it's not where you go but how you go that matters.
fresh	There's also something of Joseph Mankiewicz in Assayas' taut, gnomic gab, with professional status and personal moment indicated in snappish, contemporary dialogue.
fresh	A meditation on fame, acting, aging, and acceptance, "Clouds" is a multilayered rapture on the subject of woman, performing. Not only does the film demand repeat viewings, it rewards them.
fresh	Director Olivier Assayas is one step ahead of the audience the whole time.
fresh	Stewart's relaxation in front of the camera is something to marvel at. She is always present in the moment and seems unable to fake a scene.
fresh	Kristen Stewart, in what might be her best performance to date, entirely holds her own with Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche.
fresh	Assayas writes/directs this film in his typical cerebral style. Every scene is deliberate, every action premeditated, and every visual reference requires further examination.
fresh	Stewart is here as marvelous as only a natural movie star can be: she's "real" yet heightened, and there's nothing narcissistic about her intensity.
fresh	One of the film's delights-it is more than a mere in-joke-arises from seeing Kristen Stewart inspecting her own predicament, as it were, from the outside.
fresh	Sophisticated, profound, tender and well-acted. It's far better than the overrated Birdman.
fresh	Binoche is grappling with big themes here that must cut close to the bone -- about the process of art and reticence about aging.
fresh	...there is a lot of talk, but there is tension throughout that Assayas handles well enough, thanks in large part, to Stewart's exceptional performance...it might be a chick flick, but it's a good one. It might not be for everyone, but I liked it.
fresh	Few contemporary filmmakers can touch Assayas as a storyteller - even his most enigmatic moments here will inspire lively post-screening conversations - or as a director of actors.
fresh	Assayas knows how to create an embracing sense of intimacy among his players, and this shows itself to best advantage in the many scenes between Maria and Val.
fresh	The movie, which Olivier Assayas wrote and directed, is a world of wonders, most of them cerebrally twisty and emotionally hallucinogenic.
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria doesn't set up a facile high/low contrast or suggest our mediated age is killing Real Art. It does, however, suggest that it's real work to stay in the game as you age, whether that game is the stage or the office.
fresh	"Clouds of Sils Maria" is oodles more poetic and enigmatic than the term "backstage drama" generally encompasses.
fresh	...one of the truly great films about acting, "All About Eve" refracted through the lens of Bergman's "Persona," squared.
fresh	Hardly obvious but awfully careful, the feature plays an unexpectedly straightforward game of hesitancy, allowing lead Juliette Binoche the freedom to attack the role with startling vulnerability.
fresh	Olivier Assayas always makes heady, clever films, and Clouds of Sils Maria is no exception.
fresh	The three women in "Clouds of Sils Maria" love, talk and move, move, move, sharing lives, trading roles and performing parts. The lives they lead are messy and indeterminate, but each woman's life belongs to her.
fresh	As stirring as Binoche is as Maria, Stewart is breathtaking as Valentine. Assayas uses the issues he parses in "Sils" to zero in on a personal-professional minefield that Stewart has navigated as well.
fresh	It's a story about an aging actress' angst-filled full-circle self-realization, one that doubles as a dissection of globe-consuming pop culture even though it's mostly set in an isolated locale high up in the Alps.
fresh	Like aging, the mystery feels both frustrating and inevitable.
fresh	another subtext-laden drama from Olivier Assayas
rotten	Like the Alps it's set in, "Clouds of Sils Maria" just goes on and on. Except in its case, there are more valleys than peaks.
fresh	It's about all women, and the conflicting dual roles they are expected to play in life, more so than men: nurturer/fighter, mother/lover, submissive/dominant and so on.
fresh	A work of many moving parts, one to take apart and put back together again repeatedly.
rotten	Style, ambition and even title cloud the confusion at its heart.
fresh	Don't get hung up on metaphors. Enjoy the virtuoso acting of Binoche and Stewart, and the strange and beautiful artwork Assayas has made of them pinballing around the notion of what it means to be a woman under a microscope.
rotten	"Clouds Of Sils Maria" swirls with provocative ideas, but they're talked about more than dramatized ...
fresh	Kristen Stewart is allowed to make the most of her slightly bored, slightly agitated alto, rattling off a neverending stream of job offers and plans with cucumber cool.
fresh	This is the film that fulfills whatever promise Kristen Stewart has shown for more than a decade.
fresh	It's slight and enjoyable, but falters a bit as it strains for profundity.
fresh	A haunting look at the anxieties of a profession where blurring the line between fantasy and reality is both part of the job description and a vocational hazard.
fresh	A film of countless earthly pleasures, chief among them the faces of three very different but fascinating actresses: Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloe Grace Moretz.
fresh	Binoche and Stewart inhabit their characters' complicated friendship, whether they're doing the nuts-and-bolts, behind-the-scenes business of managing a career or getting drunk at a small casino.
rotten	A backstage drama that has all the sizzle of a glass of water resting on the windowsill, Olivier Assayas' "Clouds of Sils Maria" mistakes lack of dramatic imagination for smoldering subtlety.
fresh	A heady psychosexual drama that's steeped in dense anxieties and rich European glamour (the film was partially funded by Chanel), Olivier Assayas's latest finds the French auteur at the very top of his game.
fresh	Highly theatrical and diverting vehicle for a better-than-ever Juliette Binoche.
fresh	Sils Maria is a dazzling hall of mirrors, and behind each warped reflection stands Assayas, ready with a cocktail and a conversational icebreaker.
fresh	It's a great meta-commentary on contemporary moviemaking, with Assayas making keen observations about celebrity, blockbusters, gossip culture, and the next generation of actresses.
fresh	The movie moves as slowly as the oncoming fog, but Juliette Binoche is always a pleasure to watch ...
fresh	As you're watching, Clouds of Sils Maria feels looser and sketchier than most of Assayas's other movies; only afterward do you look back and realize how many intricate layers he's packed into it.
fresh	One of Kristen Stewart's best performances.
fresh	The result is not just an examination of showbiz for aging actress versus emerging starlets, but a treatise on how we examine and judge the fictional choices of fictional characters as opposed to the choices we make in so-called reality.
fresh	Any doubts about Kristen Stewart's true acting potential are extinguished thanks to her surprisingly nuanced and mesmerizng performance in Clouds of Sils Maria.
fresh	Explores uneven relationships and rivalries in a manner seldom seen onscreen.
fresh	"Clouds of Sils Maria" is like "All About Eve," only with Kristen Stewart and Chloe Grace Moretz as dual-threat schemers on poor Juliette Binoche.
fresh	[Assayas] comes up with three fascinating and richly detailed women here. As a bonus, he frames them in a setting of breathtaking beauty and stimulating intelligence.
fresh	A great example of a story that indicates the relationships between actors and the people they portray.
fresh	What will come as a surprise to many of her detractors is how easily Stewart holds her own opposite Binoche.
fresh	Stewart became the first American female actor ever to win a Cesar (France's answer to the Oscars) for her performance. It's deserved. She's a revelation, reminding us that her talent has been eclipsed by Twilight for far too long.
fresh	This recalls Ingmar Bergman's chamber dramas in the intensity and psychological complexity of the central relationship, yet the filmmaking is breathtakingly fluid, evoking a sense of romantic abandon.
fresh	Binoche gives possibly the most naturalistic performance of any actor I've seen at this year's festival, balancing her character's serious anxieties with a healthy sense of the absurd.
fresh	An alluring film about the mysteries of human nature as conveyed in the interactions of three women.
fresh	Clouds of Sils Maria finds plenty of fertile terrain in what should be well-trod turf.
fresh	A searing satire of an antiseptic Hollywood system, a meta-commentary on "Celebrity" culture, a melancholic evocation on the impermanence of youth, a pensive portrait of clandestine love ...
fresh	It's a genuine pleasure watching these two talented actresses engage on everything from boy troubles to the aesthetic considerations of superhero movies.
rotten	Even with excellent performances, Clouds of Sils Maria is overlong and obvious, reiterating tired points about acting, aging and identity without moving anywhere new thematically.
fresh	The pleasure in watching the film becomes a linguistic one as Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart masterfully sharpen their words and hurl them at each other like projectiles out of a blowpipe.
fresh	The director has written a rich role of a reluctant and ruefully wise observer of time. Cue the score for Der Rosenkavalier ... Travel + Leisure meets Inside the Actors Studio.
rotten	...'Sils Maria' threads through the peaks and valleys of weighty, interesting topics, but makes no lasting impression on them, insubstantial as a cloud.
fresh	A playful and captivating hybrid of Ingmar Bergman's Persona, Joseph Mankiewicz's All About Eve, and quintessentially Assayas-esque meta-mischief.
fresh	If there was ever a reminder needed of Juliette Binoche's great and enduring talent, Assayas delivers it here.
fresh	Slyly, Assayas stages the film with an intentional staginess: even natural conversations have the ring of written dialogue, and he ends every scene with a theatrical fade to black. This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama ...
fresh	A multi-layered, femme-driven meta-fiction that pushes all involved - including next-gen starlets Kristen Stewart and Chloe Grace Moretz - to new heights.
fresh	Assayas is a master of fluent, even sinuous, film-making.
fresh	An engaging, if rarefied inside look at the private world of a star.
fresh	The film gives us All About Eve without the bite, and Bergman's Persona without the anguish. But it compensates with a warmth, compassion and authority of its own.
fresh	Ms. Stewart [in] the best role of her life
fresh	Cleverly written and expertly acted, "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is a welcome, sunny treat during these final weeks of winter.
fresh	There's plenty of chemistry among the superb veteran cast.
fresh	If this film poses any questions that aren't simply redundant at this point, it's the film's frank look at age and the abrasive acknowledgement of time...
rotten	It is harmless and there are a still a few chuckles to be found in this light, bubbly confection of a film - perfect for lazy Sunday afternoon viewing.
rotten	There is way too much going on. Parallel stories for all of these characters mean most all of them aren't fully developed.
rotten	Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are the best excuses to see the second best film of the pair
fresh	The elder actors are, of course, perfect. They never overplay the comedy or the drama, and this reserve works in counterpoint to Dev Patel's high-energy patter.
fresh	The audience for whom this sequel is targeted will enjoy the predictability of a well-executed sequel.
fresh	Satisfyingly soapy sequel, culminating in a gloriously pseudo-Bollywood dance spectacle....
rotten	The whole movie is caught somewhere between apology and entitlement.
fresh	Mostly it's a chance to hear some saucy senior citizens trade barbs, with the delightful dames, Dench and Smith, making the most of it.
rotten	...a sweet and often funny movie populated by likable actors who know their business.
fresh	Not up to the original and probably doesn't need to exist at all, but this follow-up is certainly a fine way to spend a couple of hours with our old friends from the first movie.
rotten	While no doubt determined to make a sequel worthy of the original, the makers of this movie ended up with a film that comes in second best by a long shot. It achieves mediocrity only because of the talent of the actors carried over from the original film.
fresh	Shows little strain in maintaining its cute factor, thanks to the drily winning personalities of the likes of Smith, Dench, Nighy, and the comic ebullience of Patel.
rotten	It's almost guaranteed to make undemanding fans of the first smile, but it is overall an empty experience.
rotten	...the ugly attitude within The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is well-deserving of some humbling, especially as it strives to put people in their place, and not in a guest management way.
rotten	The new film affirms the idea that the hotel is a sort of pre-heaven heaven, an autumnal "opportunity for life and for passing on the value of that life to others."
fresh	A pleasant, if predictable, romantic romp laced with far more mirth than sophistication or substance.
fresh	Often motivated by financial greed, many sequels satiate businesspeople while disappointing moviegoers. But "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" manages to buck the often-botched sequel trend with yet another naturally charming film.
rotten	The filmmakers can't be faulted for a sequel, but they can be blamed for saddling their stunning cast with this half-baked, 80's sitcom-level, shell of a script. No one will be visiting The Third Best Exotic Marigold Hotel without some real renovations.
fresh	Crass, strident and over-done, second-rate second best.
fresh	As far as sequels go this second-go-round for what sounded like a one-shot deal is actually a nice step up from the delights of the first film.
rotten	Despite good stuff, the movie sputters, drags, and lurches from episode to episode, juggling way too many characters and plot complications without having much reason for existing.
fresh	Whether or not it succeeds will depend on how individual viewers weigh the movie's narrative flaws against the profound appeal of its stars and setting. For my part, it was a reminder that sometimes second best is good enough.
fresh	The film bests its predecessor, although, to be sure, the difference is slender.
rotten	Definitely second best, and not in a good way.
fresh	Like the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel itself, the novelty of the concept is a bit worse for wear, and this second go-round lacks the urgency of the first film.
fresh	Chances are, if you liked The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, you'll like the second best one as well.
fresh	There's a sweetness to the proceedings that never quite overpowers the melancholy of maturity, and a sympathy for human frailty that stops just short of suggesting that anything goes once everything starts to go.
fresh	Madden and Parker do an excellent job of weaving all the individual stories together. That, along with the rousing dance number at the end, make "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" the treat that it is.
fresh	Considering the dearth of roles for older actors, "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is a family film suitable for the non "Fifty Shades of Grey" crowd.
rotten	The most unnecessary sequel since COCOON:THE RETURN.
fresh	Douglas's halting evolution as a reborn man and Nighy's engaging reenactment of his stammers, ardor, and honesty, are prime examples of what's right in this erratic follow-up.
fresh	Sure, it has the comfy vibe of the familiar, but it's all in feel-good fun.
rotten	The actors are again terrific, but the syrup and superficiality of the first film, too, are back in this unnecessary sequel.
fresh	As in the first film, when the going gets a little too soapy or overly maudlin, the cast of mostly old pros elevate the material with the sheer force of their collective skill.
fresh	The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was such a worldwide sleeper hit, and its British-Indian cast so beloved, that it's no surprise that three years later they're back in Rajasthan.
fresh	That's the wonderful thing about great actors -- they can turn gush into gold.
rotten	Every storyline is more predictable than the first time out.
rotten	The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel caters to those who enjoyed the first film, but has otherwise completely lost what made the original film somewhat special. The humor is so unfunny that you'll be clawing your eyes out in frustration.
fresh	A bit like a second linty mint delivered from the depths of your grandmom's cardigan pocket: sweet but, really, no need.
fresh	Great cast, but sequel doesn't match original's charm.
rotten	The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is exactly that - second best.
fresh	Anyone who liked the first won't be disappointed with the sequel. Added to the story and the fine acting is the eye-popping color that is so typical of Bollywood...closing with a wonderful dance involving the entire cast.
fresh	When it does what it does well, it does it really well, and once again, it has a dreamy ensemble that has the ability to rise above the material itself.
fresh	With the cast of personalities established in the previous film, the sequel is a pleasant enough meander through the boroughs of character.
rotten	Any film that can't make good use of Nighy, an actor whose shrewd intelligence shines through even in dreck like "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans," is doing something dreadfully wrong.
rotten	The same problems as the first film also re-occur, and this time they're a bit more glaring.
rotten	There's a stretched and buffoonish quality to the aptly named "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" that detracts from any sincere sentiment or wisdom the film hopes to impart.
fresh	Kudos to John Madden for doing a sequel that isn't worn out super heroes or so-so sci-fi. The movie works but is still the second best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
fresh	As was the cast the first time around, the simple presence of the cast makes it all go down fairly easy. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's as sweet at the first but is too content to repeat itself. The result: a blend of amiability and aimlessness that helps it lives down to the "second best" in its title.
fresh	Maggie Smith, who is so sincere as Muriel, manages to make the film bearable as it comes to an emotional conclusion leaving you with a small, but definitely present, lump in your throat.
fresh	All manner of subplots weave their way through the film, which teems with "colorful" characters and saccharine cliches. But, like the first film, it's next to impossible not to find diversion in the company of such stalwarts as Dench and Nighy and Smith.
fresh	I'd love to see a third "Marigold" adventure. Better yet, a "Masterpiece Theater"-type TV series, where we get to spend an hour every week with the regulars at the hotel and various newcomers who stop in.
rotten	The only significant thing to discuss about the movie is how familiar it is...
fresh	Gently disrupts all of the happy endings of the first film just enough to allow for some minor misunderstandings, pointed commentary, and even happier endings.
fresh	Because I found the original movie so engaging, I enjoyed finding out what has happened, and what is to come, in the lives of these characters.
fresh	It uses the same phenomenal cast, sweet writing and beautiful appreciation of the Indian culture to create a film that may be "second best" but is still a winner.
fresh	Suffice to say, if you enjoyed the first Hotel you'll be equally taken with the second. And if you attended the first with low expectations and came back disappointed -- well, consider that a warning.
rotten	The film has only the sheer charm of its cast to get it by, and it says a lot about the actors that they nearly pull it off.
rotten	Performances from venerable thespians such as Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy are nuanced and piquant, but they are stuck in a story with too many moving parts - most of which are worn out from overuse - that never gets anywhere.
fresh	Sure, it's pat and occasionally patronizing and too adorable by half, but it's also a rare, optimistic portrait of aging that suggests it can be a productive, erotically charged time of life.
rotten	Sequels often get a bad rap for being nothing more than the same thing redone a subsequent time. In the case of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, it's a fair cop
rotten	Good on the Marigold team for creating unlikely franchise fare, and for resisting the temptation to coddle the mystique of their "exotic" setting. But any fear of cultural imperialism has been replaced with imperialism of dullness.
fresh	a big, bright mess of a movie whose cast and locales distract from its screenwriting lapses.
rotten	The storyline of the sequel ends up tying itself in knots, and the addition of a splashy, expensive-looking Bollywood musical number just underlines the lack of perspective.
fresh	If news of the sequel made you reminisce about the halcyon days of summer 2012, your hope is rewarded.
fresh	Much of this sequel is clumsy, and awfully silly, but consistently shallow it is not.
fresh	A mildly diverting trifle, notable for its stunning setting and some deft performances but crammed with too many forgettable subplots.
rotten	Overall it's the cinematic equivalent of warm oatmeal: It goes down easy, but has almost no flavor.
rotten	More of the same, but not as good...despite the attractive facade, the movie is a pretty ramshackle affair.
rotten	The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel grossed some $46 million, an impressive take for a niche-market release, so here comes the pointless sequel.
rotten	Compared to the adventurously life-affirming and death-acknowledging honesty of its heartfelt predecessor, this film literally comes in second in every regard.
rotten	Madden doesn't do much to make these characters pop and sizzle as they managed to do occasionally in the slightly grittier original.
fresh	When such consummate actors as Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton show up together in a movie, even a sequel as wobbly as this one, you'd be wise to just sit back and behold.
fresh	As with the original, Dench, Smith, Nighy and the rest of the standout senior ensemble cast are a joy to watch and the setting, gorgeously lensed by cinematographer Ben Smithard, will have more than one person staring wistfully at their suitcases ...
fresh	More of a second helping of comfort food than a challenging sequel.
rotten	Bland and familiar.
rotten	This is a movie built upon mistaken identity, preposterous misunderstandings and misplaced jealousy - the foundations of sitcom plotting. On the plus side, it's Maggie Smith doling out Estelle Getty's lines with Downton drollness.
fresh	The acting of course is first-rate, and the movie mostly preserves the original warmth and wit of the original.
rotten	Madden has stripped away the socio-economic context from the first film and turned the sequel into some kind of thinly rationed romantic comedy.
fresh	It's asked in the film, "How many new lives can we have?" The answer, it turns, is however many we want. And as long as Dench, Smith, Nighy and Imrie stick around, the same probably is true of "Marigold" movies.
fresh	While it's not as good as its predecessor, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel still skates by on the delightful charm of its ensemble cast.
rotten	Madden's movie is crammed with so many characters that we never spend enough quality time with any of them for their stories to resonate. While the many attempts at poignancy feel forced and false, the effort as a whole feels like it will never end.
fresh	Watching the film you just want to relax and settle back. It's the cinematic equivalent of a warm bath.
rotten	The director, John Madden, and the screenwriter, Ol Parker, who created the first film, try to compensate for the new movie's lack of coherence and narrative momentum. But with no real story to tell, only so much can be done.
rotten	Sequel-itis: Let's take this delightful little surprise hit and try to duplicate its success without doing anything original.
rotten	The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is a movie title that reviews itself.
fresh	"Second Best" offers little you couldn't write yourself, but it does so with respectable level of craft. The appeal lies in the ensemble playing.
fresh	There's something heartening about a franchise headlined by a bunch of 60-or-older stars, none of whom were catchphrase-spouting action heroes in their youth.
fresh	This sequel's very existence is a reminder that life goes on - and stays sexy, silly, dramatic and fun - long after everyone else tells you that the best times are over.
rotten	What little edge this tale had has been rubbed right off for this stale, slow and mirthless sequel
rotten	There's nothing exotic and definitely nothing "best" about this unnecessary sequel which has a mustier smell than grandma's attic.
fresh	The title may have double meaning, but the singular rewards of this sequel are as rich as the original.
fresh	It's the kind of movie that provides a perfect answer for when your mother or grandmother calls you up and asks, "What should I go see with the girls after our weekly canasta game?"
fresh	You do enjoy yourself but you'll enjoy yourself much more with a real Indian movie.
rotten	Coasting is all there is, in the hopes that these charismatic actors can somehow make tandoori chicken salad out of a screenplay full of lazily-constructed conflicts so contrived they'd get booted out of the Two and a Half Men writer's room.
fresh	It's hard to feel too much animosity for such a warm, entirely harmless film populated by some of Britain's best.
fresh	I can see no real reason for a sequel to the delicious 2011 hit The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. It was perfect the first time around. But the second jog around the track passes the time pleasantly enough.
rotten	Second best by a distressingly large margin, "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" is a pointless sequel to an overlong but charming little comedy that was never designed to launch a franchise.
rotten	Yes, there are good moments from a team of veteran British actors, but overall, this return visit to the 2012 gray-set rom-com is deadly dull.
fresh	A delightful visit with old friends and a chance to see how they are faring.
rotten	The cast, as expected, does what they can with the thin material-which is to say, not much.
fresh	Nighy, Dench and Smith effortlessly complicate their thin business with deep notes of regret and longing - feelings the blue-print of a screenplay could never dream of turning into words or actions.
fresh	If there is such a thing as a warm-bath movie, The Second Best Marigold Hotel defines it. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy just get better with age in a mild comedy that celebrates life to the very end.
fresh	Look, they're all doing it to hang out and talk about when Gielgud farted in the fourth act of Lear. It's a crass cash-in, but these old thespians are charming as hell, and the movie coasts breezily by on that alone, which is just enough.
fresh	If the first film felt like snuggling up with a warm blanket, this one is like sipping a comforting cup of warm tea.
fresh	If the harsh truth is that this follow-up is second best, it's still not half bad.
fresh	Like its predecessor, the film is a charming example of what great actors can do with mediocre material.
fresh	Whether by design or accident, the follow-up actually achieves a slight improvement upon the original in most of the departments that matter.
rotten	Mortality and the possibility of fresh beginnings remain at the forefront of "Second Best," but the novelty of the setup has drifted away.
fresh	[Maggie Smith's Muriel] stands out as the point-of-view emotional heart of this surprisingly poignant sequel.
fresh	The ramshackle but likable results will go down well with a cup of tea at what will doubtless be packed matinee screenings.
rotten	The sequel to a film about old age is more old age.
fresh	The actors are so assured that they supply the nuances the script neglects and give even the lamest lines a comic zing.
fresh	Fans of the first film (of which I am one) will be pleased to know Madden and his terrific ensemble cast deliver more of the same. We are talking feelgood with a capital F.
fresh	The movie delivers all of the expected elements, only more so. And who will complain about the Dames, Judi and Maggie, bowling a few good salty lines at each other?
rotten	Hang on! This is the Hotel Inspectors episode of Fawlty Towers with Gere playing the Bernard Cribbins role.
fresh	Those who enjoyed, or at least stayed awake for, the first film will be well satisfied, for product continuity has been maintained perfectly.
fresh	Full of mild pleasures.
fresh	Although The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is hardly groundbreaking it offers a very welcome opportunity to renew acquaintance with the characters we met and fell in love with three years ago.
fresh	This perfectly amiable comedy sequel can never quite transcend its own Saga holiday brochure-style complacency.
rotten	As the initial joy of being reunited with the colourful assemblage of talent wanes, the audience is left with a film that discernibly lacks the nuance of its predecessor.
rotten	If The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was the cinematic equivalent of a comforting chicken tikka masala ready meal, then its sequel has been left in the freezer too long and reheated to lukewarm.
fresh	Another irresistible swirl of heart-warming life lessons, funny valentines and intoxicating local Indian colour, this captivating sequel is not second best at all, more a worthy companion piece to the 2011 crowd-pleaser.
fresh	Though still treacly, still exasperatingly sentimental and stereotypical, this follow-up to the first Exotic Marigold Hotel turns out to be rather better.
fresh	The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was often referred to as 'The Avengers for pensioners'. Which I suppose would make this follow-up 'Age of Ultron for pensioners'.
rotten	A return to that sunny outpost for the elderly and infirm ushers lightly diminishing returns.
fresh	This is one hotel that's not checking out anytime soon.
fresh	There's not much of a story, just a chance to spend more time with the gang of classy sexy randy oldsters. And that's just fine.
rotten	While the sequel isn't bad, it lives up to its name as Second Best.
fresh	A badly under-developed script leaves a fine cast without much to do in this sequel to the 2012 hit...
fresh	This is pure wish fulfilment for retirees, an over-the-rainbow, Monsoon Wedding fantasy to break the monotony of trips to the Co-op, endless cups of tea and Countdown in the afternoon.
fresh	Retaining the waspish asides of the first movie but able to bring much more fragility to the fore, Smith effortlessly exposes a contradictory combination of fear and bravery that many older people will find familiar.
fresh	The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a perfectly serviceable comedy for the retirement crowd, but it has a troubling undercurrent of cultural awkwardness that's too hard to ignore.
fresh	Silver fox Richard Gere is the magic card up the filmmakers' sleeve for this warm if rambling sequel.
fresh	The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel squeaks through on its positivity and humour, with its sharp wit and trite wisdom delivered by a cast who could give a party political broadcast integrity and emotional impact.
rotten	While it's agreeable to spend another interlude with the characters we met four years ago in the first film, this second chapter is too slight, too laboured and too long to warrant as much attention
fresh	While not without its charms, Marigold 2 is a pretty naked cash-in.
fresh	The Second Best Exotic Hotel barely skates by on the strength of its older cast members, which of course is "the reason for the season" anyway.
fresh	This is undemanding, misty-eyed stuff; carried through by its seasoned, thoroughbred performers.
fresh	In the first film, India was effectively a brightly coloured obstacle course for the characters to blunder through. This time, we get to see it as the prize.
rotten	Fans of the original movie may be more forgiving of the weak storytelling and the awkward performances that make up this lackluster sequel.
fresh	A film that is reassuringly watchable, easy on the eye and does have more than a few moments to make you smile and laugh.
rotten	Honestly titled if nothing else, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sluggish also-ran compared to its predecessor, 2011's retirement-themed comedy-drama The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
fresh	For a film conceived without any chance of a sequel in mind, "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" actually lends itself surprisingly well to being extended ...
fresh	... more concerned with the psychology of horror than the blood and guts, as the film preys on common fears and paranoia without turning manipulative or sacrificing tension.
fresh	Earns its place on the list of classic horrors by honouring what came before while staking out bold new ground.
fresh	The film has style, has panache, and a strong vision ... It uses Detroit beautifully, evoking chilling foreboding from rows of deserted houses shot from the car's POV in an autumnal dread.
fresh	In It Follows, sexual activity has metaphysical implications.
fresh	The fright film du jour succeeds as both cautionary teen allegory and unnerving blend of 'Blue Velvet' and the underground 'Deadgirl' ... an instant cult classic!
fresh	Even on its own kooky, spooky terms there are lapses in plausibility here that even the most forgiving horror fan will spot, but they are more than compensated by the film's sheer number of quality shocks.
fresh	Conceived in a way that allows these cliches to be subverted, transforming... safe havens into being more dangerous and terrifying than any of the tropes themselves.
fresh	Last year it was The Babadook, but 2015's must-see horror film is this chic American indie.
fresh	While I didn't find myself particularly frightened by the film as many have suggested, I marveled at the gorgeous cinematography, retro score, and use of location.
fresh	That ceaseless slow march will likely become 2015's scariest image.
fresh	Ultimately, rather than sex, what seems threatening here is impending adulthood in all its dimensions, and in its floaty, insubstantial way, It Follows catches some of the mingled excitement and terror of growing up.
fresh	It's brilliant.
fresh	It Follows is well worth a look and if you go in not expecting the second coming of horror, you'll likely have a good time with this unique, slowburn supernatural fable.
fresh	The setting is contemporary crumbling Detroit, yet there's a strong '70s and '80s vibe, with some dreamy visuals (above ground swimming pools, cherry red bitten-down fingernails) and a creepy electro synth score by Disasterpeace.
fresh	A kind of art-house horror movie, an allegory about AIDS and, believe it or not, a love story, 'It Follows' is one of a kind.
fresh	Mitchell and his cast really make it work, and the soundtrack coats the whole thing in a sort of beautiful dread
fresh	So this is when I am going to break from the critical chorus of praise. It Follows wasn't flawless for me - and perhaps a victim of its own hype in that regard.
fresh	It Follows is bold, provocative, original, artfully made, perfectly acted, and creepy as hell.
fresh	The next time some old lady starts following you with an emotionless stare on her face, you are going to lose your mind.
fresh	It Follows has an impressively sustained sense of dread, less explicit gore than measured tension. Mitchell slyly inverts the conventions of dead-meat teenager flicks, although not with wink-wink comedy like the Scream series.
fresh	Formally and visually it is a work of real craftsmanship, and it displays a conscious understanding of the paradoxes of the heart that the horror genre plumbs so well.
rotten	"Follows" Fails to Follow Through
fresh	It's a wildly fun conceit ... Mitchell's atmospheric rendering of It Follows gives the film a fanciful, otherworldly feel.
fresh	Easily the best horror film I've seen since "The Cabin in Woods" (2012), "It Follows" is an instant classic.
fresh	This is a genuinely creepy movie with a few scary moments, mostly caused by sudden, loud noises and quick film cuts. The landscape of urban decay is used to good effect. The raggedy edges of Detroit look like row upon row of haunted houses.
fresh	The perfect viewer for It Follows is one who wants to see the unsettling things that happen when genres and their expectations collide.
fresh	Even though the setup creates little more than variations on the same basic threat, the film maintains a rigorous tension that is as unrelenting as the ambiguous monstrosity that keeps coming at us.
fresh	Tense, creepy, filled with dread.... We're not afraid of what the characters are afraid of. We're just AFRAID.
fresh	What the movie acknowledges is that the biological imperative that perpetuates the human race carries its own curse of mortality -- that the act of reproduction passes on both the gift of life and a death sentence.
fresh	...both memorable and controversial, inspiring the kind of water cooler horror-fan talk that the 'The Ring' managed to generate before it was diluted with all the sequels.
fresh	Good horror films rely on suspense and tension, and this one has both elements aplenty.
fresh	It Follows has a unique concept that somehow combines elements from some of your favorite supernatural films with cult classic slashers, but the appeal wears off due to its sluggishness. It comes nowhere near the hype it is receiving.
fresh	The film might not be as deep as it aspires to be, but It Follows is one retro horror movie that's quite creepy and has style to spare.
fresh	Even when you strip away the subtext and symbolism, It Follows is just a genuinely creepy movie.
fresh	It Follows specifically pays tribute to Carpenter's horror precedent in its middle-class setting, its likable characters and its spare, nerve-fraying musical soundtrack.
fresh	Remember, kids, when you have sex, you're having sex with every person they've ever had sex with. And also with a demon stalking all of you.
fresh	The better things in "It Follows" are a tempting tease for what the film's young director will do next.
fresh	Stylish filmmaking, invigorating and delightfully creepy.
fresh	...unique and arresting.
fresh	"It Follows" is the creepiest movie in years.
fresh	Less a conventional scary horror film than a fitful, disturbing dream, It Follows is all about atmosphere, with an unsettling soundscape and dislocating widescreen imagery.
fresh	Despite that title -- and the debt owed to 1970s cinema, most glaringly in the film's creepy techno-organ score -- It Follows largely charts its own path.
fresh	It Follows manages to bend the rules of fateful juvenile sexuality, and does so in a manner that genuinely tingles the spine and disturbs the mind.
fresh	It Follows builds terror that finds its scares through all the earmarks of a very vivid nightmare.
fresh	It's hard not to share Jay's mounting panic as she watches the thing in its various guises walking slowly toward her wherever she may be, invisible to everyone else and entirely intent on destroying her.
fresh	It succeeds as a thriller, with performances that strike a grave, quiet tone suited to the film's wide shots, long takes and carefully cultivated mood of foreboding.
fresh	Writer/director David Robert Mitchell forms a provocative filmic world of slowly unfolding secrets, creating a highly disturbing, highly recommended nightmare.
fresh	It horrifies. It disturbs. It rules.
fresh	I wanted to follow it, too.
fresh	It Follows has style to burn, and the cinematography, coupled with a nuanced, synth-heavy soundtrack keeps ratcheting up the tension in smart and creative ways.
fresh	The matters of sex and lost innocence work like a thematic undertow, pulling the characters down into the dark, psychological depths.
fresh	Promises more than it delivers, but engrossing throughout.
fresh	It's about many things, but dread infuses them all. You won't be grossed out. You'll be creeped out. And that's a lot more satisfying.
fresh	There's just enough detail to the movie's mythology to make it hold together, and just enough left unexplained to make things genuinely eerie.
fresh	Every once in a while a low-budget indie fright flick comes along that makes everything on the major studios' horror plate look like a pile of steaming crap.
fresh	Accomplished work, always interesting to watch, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential, finding Mitchell scrambling to reclaim suspense lost to budgetary and thespian limitation.
fresh	One of those rare scary machines where everything just clicks together, with a ferociously single-minded rightness that keeps the nerves in a state of high, perpetual thrum.
fresh	While I don't quite think that David Robert Mitchell's It Follows is one of the scariest movies ever made, it is certainly one of the most unsettling.
fresh	It's all made more powerful and paranoia-inducing because the shuffling stalkers could be anyone, anytime, anywhere. They're as inexplicable as they are impossible to escape.
fresh	Mitchell reshapes tried-and-true scare conventions - teens in peril, a relentless malevolent force, jarring soundtrack - into an unexpectedly unique creepfest. And his riffs on sex and adulthood are refreshing in their allegorical complexity.
fresh	Most of it evokes the attacks on lust that flourished in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and The Birds and that were rampant in the high school nightmare movies of the 1970s and 1980s.
fresh	Brilliant genre filmmaking, nicely sinister camera moves, excellent cast, superbly terrifying score by Disasterpeace.
fresh	It Follows is both scary enough to please horror fans and deep enough to inspire term papers.
fresh	"It Follows" is a truly electrifying, even hair-raising horror film. But it doesn't rely on gore to jangle our nerves. It merely preys on our imagination.
fresh	Delivers enough scares for those looking for them. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	It Follows is as scary as it is because, in part, it doesn't try to be scary.
fresh	Mitchell's skills in crafting mood and building tension result in one of the most mesmerizing and suspenseful horror movies to come along in a long time.
rotten	Follows is an effective pastiche but a studied one; by the end, even its ambiguities feel overdetermined.
fresh	A sophisticated twist on the standard "have sex and die" themes of maniac movies from the late 1970s and early 1980s.
fresh	Where most teen horror movies revel in the peer group splintering and getting slaughtered, this one is more interested in how people gather around a loved one and shield her from harm.
fresh	Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, from last year, turned parenthood into the scariest story of all, and now comes David Robert Mitchell's It Follows, which merges paranoia and teen sexuality into an exercise in delicious dread.
fresh	An assured piece of filmmaking that works as both a horror movie and a coming-of-age story.
rotten	Mitchell conjures up plenty of eerie atmospherics - the camerawork and "Halloween"-esque score are excellent - but the film never reaches terrifying heights.
fresh	"It Follows" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's also one of the most beautiful.
fresh	Creates a quiet just waiting to be pierced, observing the experience of being young and finding normalcy punctured by something new and potentially scary.
fresh	It Follows deserves to be a hit; it's the pearl you search through loads of home-brewed horror to find.
fresh	Michael Gioulakis's cinematography, more art-house than genre with its eerie pools of light at night, brings an arrestingly static, tableau-like quality that echoes the highly staged scenarios of Gregory Crewdson's photos.
fresh	...David Robert Mitchell's It Follows stands out as one of the stronger horror offerings of recent years.
fresh	Not since Freddy Krueger stalked teenagers in their sleep have I felt so completely like the poor kids on screen had nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide.
fresh	From the opening moments, the one thing clear about It Follows is that it will not follow in everyone else's footsteps.
fresh	It Follows is itself a film that thrives in the borders, not so much about the horror that leaps out in front of you, but the deeper anxiety that waits at the verge of consciousness.
fresh	Written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, It Follows is the latest in a long line of sex-as-horror flicks that somehow grounds its terror both in reality and in the otherworldly, making this a smart and thought-provoking movie.
fresh	A wonderful horror film.
fresh	An intricate piece of work that derives its significant scares out of sheer cinematic bravado.
fresh	It's an undeniable triumph of mood - perfect for anyone who wants to practice clenching their fists for nearly 100 straight minutes - as well as an ambitious effort at reinventing horror by eschewing the genre's common tricks.
fresh	Mitchell pulls off a tricky balance with his ingenious response to 80's horror films where teenage sex meant death and monsters walked leafy suburban streets in broad daylight by presenting his original, nightmarish idea via an homage to John Carpenter.
fresh	"It Follows" is not really about sex, but an unbearable, unsinkable mood that descends when you come of age, and never completely dissipates, not even after climactic sexual, or other violent acts.
fresh	Unlike many working in this genre, Mitchell doesn't punish young women for having sex: This is a gender-blind demonic delivery vehicle.
fresh	My whole life I've been a horror-movie freak, and I've rarely been as scared as I was at It Follows. But it wasn't a fun kind of scare. It was the so-upset-I-feel-sick kind of amorphous dread.
fresh	A creepy, counterintuitive fright fest that puts a perverse spin on the meaning of getting lucky.
fresh	"It Follows" pretty much earns its buzz as the scariest and best-engineered American horror movie of recent years, and that's all down to Mitchell's sophisticated understanding of technique and the trust and freedom he accords his youthful cast.
fresh	One more stylish reminder of how readily we the people can be creeped out.
fresh	[A] smart, relentlessly chilling thriller that opts for originality over cheaply rejiggered jolts.
fresh	A dizzyingly tense and creepy workout.
fresh	A beautifully shot, nicely acted, oddly multilayered movie. And one based on the simplest scare of all: Don't look now, but something's behind you.
rotten	Can one perfectly-executed shot redeem the less successful earlier attempts? In this case, after the initial awe wears off, the effect is the opposite: it only makes you realize how much more there was to mine from Mitchell's premise all along.
fresh	It Follows is yet another example of how smart the indie horror game is these days.
fresh	Rather than breaking new ground, "It Follows" recycles familiar teenage horror tropes - a girl alone in a house, evil forces banging on a door - but its mood is dreamy. Seldom do you feel manipulated by exploitative formulas.
fresh	Agreeably unsettling if not the terrifying experience some have claimed.
fresh	[A] teen slasher with one killer hook
fresh	There are ordinary homages and then there are high-quality cinematic mix tapes like It Follows.
rotten	It Follows may have a pretty terrifying premise - the kind of story that urban legends are born from - but it's much scarier in concept than execution.
fresh	The creature's terrifying persistence taps into a base fear that audiences may not have felt this strongly since Romero's slow-moving living dead first shambled onto screen.
fresh	Writer-director David Robert Mitchell has clearly studied up on John Carpenter. But Mitchell has his own twisted gift for letting atmosphere help define character. It Follows creeps you out big-time.
fresh	The film turns its viewers into paranoid spectators, scanning the frame for signs of trouble.
fresh	With long-building fears and sudden shocks both in profusion, It Follows is one of the better horror films in recent memory precisely because it turns the border between the everyday and the supernatural into a knife-edge that cuts deep into your fears.
fresh	In love with old-school John Carpenter scares, this film will unsettle you from its first moments. Some of its ideas are just as chilling as its shocks.
rotten	The most fun will be in dissecting it afterwards. Film school professors, look forward to a decade of term papers.
fresh	A radically fresh, hair-raisingly inventive take on a thought-worn subgenre. In spite of its stop-and-start narrative structure, few motion pictures achieve the level of usurping dread that "It Follows" manages.
fresh	Mitchell puts a twist on familiar tropes, enhanced by Rich Vreeland's eerily atmospheric electronic score and witty references to horror-meisters from George A. Romero to John Carpenter.
fresh	If the kids think this is the scariest thing ever, then so be it.
fresh	Mitchell's deft handling of relationships gets threaded into an ingenious and exceedingly skillful creepshow.
fresh	A "dead teenager movie" that gives teenagers, and others, a moral dilemma to ponder? Hair-raising. Literally.
fresh	A relentless working of the nerves done with techniques cribbed from the avant-garde.
fresh	"It Follows" is a fine title, blending a logician's briskness with the job description of a stalker, and David Robert Mitchell, the writer and director, has fun with his various predators.
fresh	Though visionary, David Robert Mitchell's film abounds in undigested ideas and dubious sexual politics.
fresh	Part 2 will surely establish the monster has a twitter account.
fresh	As kind to its audience as it is to its characters.
fresh	The crash-bang-wallop set pieces are economically choreographed and efficiently edited, but their real weight comes from the sense of brooding menace established in interim sequences in which not very much appears to be happening.
fresh	This is horror boiled down to its bones.
fresh	The remorseless antagonist is genuinely horrifying, all the more so because its malignity is seemingly motiveless.
fresh	Mitchell is sensitive to the complicated nuances of teenage friendship, rooting the horror in relationships that are believable and affecting.
fresh	This brilliantly unsettling, determinedly awkward film confirms that there is plenty of life in the high-end horror movie.
rotten	Wait. Really? Horror movies are still doing the punishing-girls-for-having-sex thing? Ah, but this is 80s retro, so it's 'okay,' then.
fresh	Acted on me as all good horror films should, generating that prickly shiver through the shoulders and into the neck.
fresh	Mitchell's skill is to take this prosaic truism and turn it into poetry that is as terrifying and seductive as the score (by Disasterpeace), which ranges from the plaintively melancholy to crunchy, distorted walls of electronic noise.
fresh	The ingenious new teen horror film It Follows will intrigue, puzzle and trouble audiences by turns.
fresh	The first thing that strikes you about It Follows is that it's a film made with love. And that's something that you infrequently get to say about horror films.
fresh	You won't see anything more scary this year. Unless it sees you first.
fresh	Just when it seemed that there would never be another original teen horror movie comes this rough-edged but pleasingly creepy American indie ...
fresh	A first-rate horror movie, It Follows adds a new monster to the pantheon.
fresh	It Follows unremittingly pursues the two greatest themes in both art and life, as its adolescent kids learn to stave off with sex, however temporarily, the ineluctable approach of death.
fresh	I don't think I have ever had a nightmare quite as scary as this film - a modern classic of fear to be compared to something by a young Carpenter or De Palma.
fresh	With an inventive retro style, writer-director David Robert Mitchell offers an enjoyable riff on the teen horror movie...
fresh	It won't let you go and you can't shake it off. Whether you like it or not.
fresh	A horror film that will haunt your waking hours for weeks. Every frame of It Follows is stamped with nameless dread.
fresh	Passive and relentless, familiar and terrifying, predictable and shocking - and impossible to shake off.
fresh	A sense of dread envelopes every scene thanks to combination of Mitchell's slow, measured tracking shots and the stunning score from Disasterpeace.
fresh	A bold, terrifying attack of cinema, immersive on the levels of imagery both beautiful and grotesque, and scares from the shallowest to the most pervasive.
fresh	Mitchell's measured camera movements and dedication to slow burn scares with big, terrifying payoffs are worth the price of admission alone.
fresh	Go into It Follows oblivious of what you're about to see and you'll exit terrified. It lingers.
fresh	Though visionary, It Follows abounds in undigested ideas and dubious sexual politics.
fresh	It Follows is a lot like sex; even when it's kind of bad it's still pretty good.
fresh	There's a primal fear at work here - everyone gets nervous about being followed - and even though the monster is fiction, I suspect the anxiety may pursue the viewer home.
fresh	A hauntingly original and genuinely unsettling take on familiar spooky elements that ultimately doesn't quite hang together and might even alienate hardcore horror fans.
fresh	Suspenseful, atmospheric and spine-tingling horror cinema which nods at the masters and completely astounds as it manages the tough feat of being striking, sensitive and utterly disturbing.
fresh	A low budget horror that injects new blood into the genre's evergreen 'teen sex has horrifying consequences' trope.
fresh	It's not about why things happen so much as it's about why those things can be frightening.
fresh	A lot of horror movies use sex, or talk about sex, or even talk about how other horror movies use sex, but very few get to the root of what's actually scary about it.
fresh	...one of the most inventive, exciting, and truly frightening horror flicks to come around in ages.
fresh	Despite all the fun-to-unpack ideas swirling around Mitchell's premise, this is first and foremost a showcase for his considerable talents as a widescreen visual stylist ...
fresh	David Robert Mitchell's idea might be the definition of "Slow Burn", but besides a few insignificant pacing issues, It Follows is a horrific work of art with a fresh, rewarding concept.
fresh	Truly unsettling. One of the best horror movies to come along in a while.
fresh	Starting off strong before losing its way in the end, this stylish, suspenseful chiller should significantly broaden Mitchell's audience without disappointing his early supporters in the slightest.
fresh	Refreshingly unironic in its retro vibe (it nods to the classics, but never winks), for us It Follows worked like gangbusters as an exercise in atmosphere and allusion...
fresh	Canny manipulation of tone, atmosphere and tension makes this a satisfying little horror movie.
fresh	Tender, remarkably ingenious and scalp-pricklingly scary.
fresh	Plays the teen horror conventions skillfully - and attractively ...
fresh	It's a work that manages to be both old school and very fresh, a wonderfully restrained film that still packs quite a punch.
fresh	Gorgeously filmed (director Collet-Serra and cinematographer Martin Rhue give New York City its own starring role in the film) and strongly acted
fresh	Car chases, running in the subways, fights and shots fired in bars make Run All Night a piece of great entertainment.[full review in Spanish]
fresh	Run All Night uses the same formula that we saw on the previous Liam Neeson films. However there is great difference that sets it apart from the rest: this time he has a complex character to play. [full review in spanish]
fresh	Run All Night doesn't give us scenes that are going to become cinematic classics, but it's gonna make people relax and see that the love of a father to his son is stronger than any situation and unexpected events. [full review in Spanish]
fresh	Definitely, Run All Night is a good thriller that shows Jaume Collet keeps getting better as a director, Neeson demonstrates that he's still a trustworthy action hero, and this time he's surrounded by a competent cast. [full review in spanish]
fresh	It's not a classic nor a bad movie, and it does tap more into the vibe of American noir classic films. [full review in spanish]
fresh	Surprisingly, the "Liam Neeson and his particular skills" formula is still working. [full review in spanish]
rotten	Just one of those films you end up seeing on a Sunday night when there is nothing else to watch on tv.
rotten	The importance of this film for Nesson could be genuine. Death is a closing symbol that suggests the end of the chases and the killing onscreen for the actor. [full review in spanish]
fresh	Run All Night is a satisfying tale of revenge and regret, with carefully crafted characters, and thrilling action.
fresh	It is a classic worthy of applause. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	'Run All Night' is an average actioner with above-average performers as the leads.
rotten	Run All Night could be the worst one yet, as it simply goes through the motions without doing much of anything particularly interesting.
rotten	Neeson will also woo many with his charm (he makes for a worthy good-bad guy) but on the whole, Run All Night is a little underwhelming.
fresh	a generally solid piece of entertaining, but hardly earth-shattering, genre work that makes good use of Neeson's brusque screen presence
fresh	Run All Night might not be original or a message movie or even a film that will be debated during the drive home, but action fans won't want to be anywhere else for one hour and 54 minutes in a theater.
fresh	Brad Inglesby's script is serviceable but it's the casting that gives the whole exercise gravitas.
fresh	while it's a stretch as an abstract idea, there is something about Neeson turning from shambling husk to fast-thinking killing machine that makes it seem completely reasonable. He believes it enough for all of us
fresh	A nasty movie with great pace and a strong spine thanks to two alchemic leads.
fresh	The dark, grim Run All Night delivers the action goods while giving Neeson a chance to show us all over again what a great actor, and screen presence, he is.
rotten	There are a few odd left turns, such as the appearance of the rapper Common as a cool assassin, on the way to a lumbering and preordained conclusion.
fresh	With the exception of the first Taken film (which, let's face it, should have been the only Taken film) this taut little Liam Neeson actioner could just be the best shoot'em upper he's done so far.
rotten	It comes across as a more lifeless version of last fall's Keanu Reeves vehicle John Wick.
fresh	If any of his movies was ever to reflect [Neeson's] current career trajectory of fine performances in average fare, it's this one.
fresh	If you appreciate this kind of guff, then Run All Night, despite its slow spots, is a fairly good yarn.
rotten	Mostly a bore, a bunch of great ingredients that combine into something surprisingly bland.
fresh	Neeson and Harris really are quite wonderful actors. They bring a dignity and depth of feeling to their roles even as the filmmakers do everything in their power to turn them into characters in a second-rate Frank Miller comic.
fresh	...often calls to mind the stripped-down machismo of Walter Hill's earlier films, full of growling men and growing menace.
fresh	In the main, Jaume Collet-Serra is making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor, and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare.
rotten	Run All Night fancies itself a remix of Taken, John Wick and Michael Winner's Mechanic, with a whole lot of Michael Mann and even a little Abel Ferrara to boot.
rotten	Gritty, fast-paced - and quickly forgettable...
fresh	Neeson, Kinnaman, Harris and D'Onofrio all give strong performances in this film. The main characters are believable. While the story does have some unnecessary detours, it is basically a good, powerful drama with enough action to satisfy action fans.
rotten	For the most part ... it's a film about Neeson punching and shooting people while looking a bit bedraggled and a touch hungover.
fresh	An occasionally-too-flashy, but otherwise pleasingly old-school tale of twisted loyalties, revenge and bloody redemption.
fresh	Run All Night is a taut, edgy affair that features Neeson in peak action form and allows him to partially atone for the indignity of Taken 3.
rotten	...occasionally nails its grizzled '70s tough guy shtick but mostly it delivers a tired jumble of sloppy genre cliches, stupid character choices, and unnecessary action sequences. Neeson is clearly punching below his weight class.
fresh	It's a ripper of a film, filled with action, tension and drama
rotten	It's just a matter of time before Neeson's killing sprees no longer slay audiences. He may look for them, but I'm pretty certain he won't find them.
fresh	Exhausting, relentless ... Neeson and Collet-Serra's third pairing is by far their best ... Fuses vertiginous CG effects with some of the most elaborate action scenes since Michael Mann's 'Heat.'
fresh	Liam Neeson was looking spent in the decidedly short-winded Taken 3, but the entertainingly brisk Run All Night happily shows that he still has the legs as cinema's ruggedly heroic action dad.
rotten	I can't help but imagine that the following conversation took place between Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford on the set of K-19: The Widowmaker.
fresh	Run All Night could stand to lose a few pounds of sub-plot and character padding. But it's good to have your favorite hamburger back -- and your dad will love it.
fresh	It is the fact that I enjoy watching Neeson doing these roles that pretty much saves Run All Night.
fresh	In the vein of those tough guy Warner Bros movies of the 40's , Liam Neeson and Ed Harris show what pro acting is all about in this edge-of-your-seat action thriller that may be far-fetched , but highly entertaining anyway.
fresh	That the two fathers are tortured by their shared past ... add[s] a layer of gravity to otherwise stock action fare.
fresh	Neeson and Harris, especially, have a touching shorthand, and an unspoken bond, in their scenes together.
fresh	Run All Night is a solidly hard-boiled crime picture infused with true moments of bravado, and we should enjoy Neeson's continued late-career action renaissance while it lasts.
fresh	[A]n overall well-made little action-oriented crime story with some interesting characters, entertaining action, and good performances from its two big leads.
rotten	There are more phones than female characters, who spend the movie comatose in hospital beds, fretting silently in the background or being hugged through a doorway
fresh	This thriller may be paint-by-numbers with cliches all around, but no one is better at giving you pure enjoyment in this action genre at this time than Neeson. It's "Taken meets The Warriors."
fresh	Run All Night marks a slight uptick in the stock of 'Liam Neeson With a Gun' action movies.
fresh	At this point, the question is not whether Liam Neeson will kick ass, but what sort of ass he will kick.
fresh	Compared to most action films, Run All Night is just fine; a little consideration and better writing might, just might, have elevated it above the pack of B-grade action films it resolutely strands itself in.
rotten	In the end, one's heart should ache a bit for this story of a father's shot at redemption. Instead, one's head aches a bit from all the tech trickery and a particularly percussive soundtrack.
rotten	With all due respect for Harris's ability to overact even while underacting, and given the hour-plus of citywide demolition, the stakes for the action here are awfully low.
fresh	The talking point today will be about how Run All Night is one of many Neeson action movies, but what will be remembered years later is that it's one of the best.
rotten	For a feature entitled "Run All Night," this claptrap lumbers and stumbles around, moving at a pace that would make a marathon runner impatient.
rotten	The third collaboration between Neeson and Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra is made almost endurable by excellent acting from Neeson (his wounded eyes are hypnotic) along with Ed Harris, as Jimmy's mercurial boss Shawn.
fresh	An entertaining NYC-set revenge picture in which grizzled Irishmen go at each other across the gritty streets that have inflamed the imaginations of filmmakers for decades.
rotten	It's dull enough to make you yawn but too loud to let you fall asleep.
fresh	While this particular bandwagon is fast running out of road, Run All Night shows there's mileage in it yet.
rotten	Liam Neeson undoubtedly possesses "a very particular set of skills." That just isn't enough this time.
rotten	('Run All Night') is formulaic to the point of boredom. It's kind of like watching a football game where you already know the final score.
rotten	It's winter also known as time for a Liam Neeson "Taken" knockoff.
fresh	An admirable cat-and-mouse tale that puts forth a lot of cliches and executes them with B-movie intensity.
fresh	The film works best as a straight character drama as opposed to the elaborate action thriller that it arguably doesn't want to be.
fresh	Well directed with nonstop action highlighted by tension-enhancing music, exceptional cinematography, and good dialogue. This is a chase film that should have the entire audience shaking in its boots throughout.
fresh	... Changes the formula enough to be Neeson's best actioner since "Taken."
fresh	The film may not be a critical favorite, but it will be an audience favorite. Run All Night is the first must-see action film of the year.
fresh	"Run All Night" is proof that quality action films don't really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they make it spin this smoothly.
fresh	Director Jaume Collet-Serra gets fine work in his handful of scenes featuring Neeson and Harris and as the worn down police detective who's been on Jimmy's trail for over a decade, Vincent D'Onofrio exudes good old-fashioned rumpled New Yawk tenacity.
fresh	Mostly thanks to its stars, it is a perfectly acceptable, if unnecessary, addition to the angry middle-aged guy action-movie genre.
rotten	Run All Night isn't dull. The pace is breakneck, and necks get broken. But the violence is relentless, ugly, unredeemed by any real humanity.
rotten	If Ed Harris can't save a movie, it can't be saved.
fresh	The great Joel Kinnaman tips the scales in our favor in the generic, but perfectly adequate, Run All Night.
fresh	There is rather more of it than is strictly necessary, but Run All Night will do well enough for a shoulder-season screen holder.
rotten	Very close to being a good movie, but they try too hard to make it about more than what it needs to be.
fresh	Collet-Serra (Non-Stop and Unknown), lavishes the story with whooshing aerial cameras and shadowy rat-warren interiors.
fresh	Another week, another snarling slab of Neesonalia. This one is a superior sample.
fresh	While it may not stray too far from familiar territory, Run All Night is a fast and entertaining example of just why its star's action rebirth has been so successful.
fresh	With a morbid, heart-in-mouth atmosphere and some enjoyably showy visuals, Run All Night is a watchable thriller that continues Neeson's successful run as an action king for the aged.
rotten	The movie is the cinematic equivalent of junk food. It satisfies the craving for the sensation of nihilism, without its substance.
fresh	Directed, frantically, by Jaume Collet-Serra, written by Brad Ingelsby, "Run All Night" promises a sprint punctuated by a lot of gunfire, and bleeding, and bodies. Mission accomplished.
fresh	The sheer perversity of Neeson's thrillers is a big part of their delight.
fresh	It's not only the strength of the acting that pulls us over bumps in the narrative, it's the crisp, streamlined direction of Spanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed Neeson in the improbable "Non-Stop."
fresh	It shows how good those "Taken" movies could have been if they'd been made by decent filmmakers.
rotten	The story loses its convincingly scaled sense of jeopardy in the late going, and it ultimately unravels.
fresh	Neeson and Harris are good at this sort of thing. The outcome is never in doubt, but an amazing amount of firepower is employed to get there.
rotten	Though Neeson, as usual, gives an effective performance, maybe it's time for him to lighten up and climb out of his rut. "Run All Night" feels like he's run into a career dead end.
fresh	"Run All Night" is a mostly satisfying action-drama from director Jaume Collet-Serra, who made Neeson's "Non-Stop" such a guilty pleasure.
rotten	Liam Neeson warns us what we're in for from the first voiceover at the start of "Run All Night": "I've done terrible things in my life."
rotten	If you're a fan of the "Taken" movies and tend to give action-hero Neeson the benefit of the doubt, our advice here is simple: Run away!
rotten	Under all his action-star antics, Liam Neeson is a good actor. So his insistence on repeatedly playing a variation of the same role is mystifying.
fresh	There's nothing new here but thank God it's not TAKEN 4. There is no annoying daughter but there are two annoying sons.
fresh	Neeson's whiskey-marinated Catholic anguish isn't exactly new, nor is Harris's rueful reflection on years flown. But if it's a film that sticks to the old songs, at least it plays the hits.
rotten	Another month, another Liam Neeson action movie.
fresh	Liam Neeson's global punching roadshow rolls on.
fresh	Yeah, it's not perfect, but with Neeson as the lead, it just have to be serviceable and that's all he needs to make this an engaging no-frills action flick.
rotten	A virtual compendium of action cliches that's efficiently made but in the end totally superfluous.
fresh	Let's face facts: Mr. Neeson is the best actor the action genre has had in decades.
rotten	Of the Badass Neeson genre, "Run All Night" is one of the worst, and probably one of the last.
fresh	Superficially it's a straight up action film with a bunch of gun battles, but there's also an undercurrent of trying to be more than that, to sprinkle the mayhem with a dash of character and intelligence.
fresh	The latest Liam Neeson vehicle is an enjoyably overcooked latter-day film noir with a heavyweight cast all mugging it up.
fresh	a solid B-movie with A-list acting
rotten	"Run All Night" is the very embodiment of the rental recommendation: If you lower your expectations sufficiently, you'll be fine. But why lower them that much?
fresh	Deserves a healthy measure of respect for unearthing a rich, world-weary vein of noir fatalism. It'd punch you if it could.
rotten	A dumb bang bang crash bang of a movie that only takes time away from its various dumb shootout scenes for its various dumb talking scenes.
rotten	Liam Neeson's most arthritic action movie yet isn't one with a number wedged in its title. It's difficult to not think about the fun and finesse "John Wick" brought to a similar scenario, and how joylessly obligatory all of this feels by comparison.
rotten	Even though the scenario features messy emotions and uneasy relationships, the movie finds the simplest, most obvious solutions...
rotten	Runs out of gas and initial viewer interest long before things play out pretty much as most everyone will easily predict. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Run All Night sports enough high-caliber performances, memorable camera work and top-notch action scenes that if this had been Taken 3, it would have certainly been a far better way to end that franchise.
fresh	Sprints across the screen, and save for one glaring misstep, entertains from start to finish.
fresh	This is part of the fun of watching Neeson. The 62-year-old actor's face has the kind of topography that would make a mountain range jealous.
fresh	It's well-crafted creative wrapping over a lot of empty noise.
rotten	Unfortunately, the convoluted backstory is the only thing that makes this worth seeing.
rotten	Run All Night hardly bores... But the all-important details don't add up here.
fresh	"Run All Night" is classic film noir. The anti-hero is a tipsy killer with a few redeeming qualities. Neeson plays the role with the same gusto that's lifted his other action films from the dismal to the watchable.
rotten	It's become so tiresome watching [Neeson] play the same character again and again that the film is even more forgettable than usual.
rotten	Completely workmanlike and predictable in execution
fresh	Refreshingly, the film resists the Old Ways Are Best subtext so common to the recent crop of geriatric shoot-'em-ups, even as it leans into cliches of much older crime pictures.
fresh	One of Liam Neeson's better recent vehicles.
rotten	Run All Night will be lucky if it runs all week. This one's dead on arrival.
rotten	There are several times in the movie in which Neeson uses his wits instead of bullets to extricate himself from a difficult situation. In this kind of picture, that's called a plot twist.
rotten	This time around, in spotlighting Liam Neeson's fatigued charisma, Jaume Collet-Serra's formidable filmmaking chops have plateaued.
rotten	Too long and too same-old, and even Liam Neeson's effortless tough-guy charm can only carry this familiar-feeling film so far.
fresh	With a script by Brad Ingelsby (Out of the Furnace), this thriller has more substance than most...
rotten	The feature fails to ignite, with the actor and the movie revealing more of a limp than a full gallop, while Collet-Serra goes cross-eyed trying to keep his action sequences in a straight line.
rotten	For something new and different, Run All Night stars Liam Neeson (Taken) as a concerned parent with a particular set of deadly skills.
fresh	With Neeson on fine form and an encouraging start, it's a shame that this gritty crime drama feels the need to erupt into a full-blown action movie by the end.
fresh	Run All Night is certainly no classic, but will prove quite satisfactory for Neeson completists.
fresh	Neeson sells it the way he sells everything: with total conviction and a physical grace that belies his big frame.
fresh	Even though he never gets a grip on the over-complicated plot, the director hasn't lost his knack for those elemental qualities that make a good action flick.
rotten	It wants to be a '70s throwback but also can't help being a silly thriller, one that eventually employs a most lazy cliche: the unstoppable (but probably stoppable) super-deadly/-expensive hitman (Common, sans facial hair).
rotten	This pedestrian thriller plonks poor Liam Neeson back in a leather jacket and armed with a gun for another one of those 'Taken Lite' outings.
rotten	[Liam Neeson and Ed Harris'] few scenes together are surrounded by clumsy plot twists, with an excess of wheel spinning and other delaying tactics.
fresh	Liam Neeson delivers afresh in an edge-of-your-seat, high body-count thriller every bit as good as they come!
fresh	A first-person shooter thriller, dark and grim, for the Just for Men/Grecian Formula set.
rotten	We've been up and down this road before, and even though Kinnaman, Neeson and Harris make interesting passengers, the overused tires in "Run All Night" go bald.
fresh	While "Run All Night" might be ten minutes too long, it's still an undeniably hardboiled work of crime fiction
rotten	Dramatically, it's better than Taken 3, but it doesn't offer anything particularly memorable or lasting.
fresh	There's not much new in this tale of grim men staring, and then shooting, each other down, but this cast and crew know how to spin this yarn with efficacy and economy.
rotten	While the dramatic themes echo the great crime movies of the seventies, it's the modern flash and muscle that ultimately win out in this pacey yet less than satisfying action thriller.
rotten	The movie consists entirely of angry threats, pointed guns, hiding out from and eluding same and mad dashes down mean streets on foot and in vehicles.
fresh	Liam Neeson does his thing, and does it well, in this robustly satisfying Irish-American mob thriller.
fresh	Anybody who pays for a ticket to see the latest Neeson actioner will know exactly what's in store - and it's safe to say this doesn't disappoint in that regard.
fresh	It doesn't break any new ground, but Run All Night is still a decent entry into the increasingly crowded "Liam Neeson in a leather jacket saving his kid from gangsters" genre.
fresh	This ensemble film brings in enough elements from comedy to drama that it becomes a moving, enjoyable treat highlighted by surprising performances.
rotten	Despite the blazing guns, this script is not so tough.
fresh	A gritty, inner-city saga of Shakespearean proportions shot on location in West Philadelphia. Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art though Romeo? I be hanging with my homeys, mama!
fresh	The film manages to transcend these cliches to create something that is original and innovative enough to warrant a watch even for veterans of the genre.
fresh	Well intended, modest sports movie separates itself from the pack
fresh	A rousing crowd pleaser about an underdog track team that can proudly takes its place among these other fine sports films.
rotten	It gives a big-screen face to an American culture generally relegated to the margins of mainstream movies. Too bad it belabors as many stereotypes as it challenges.
fresh	In a time when organized school, college and professional sports are tainted by corruption, this is a throwback to sports movies of old. It inspires us, and shows us we are stronger united than we are when we are divided.
fresh	McFarland, USA may not take us anywhere new but it gets us to the finish line with know-how and an aim to please.
fresh	The first great film of 2015. Kevin Costner knows his way around this kind of story and is wonderful. Inspiring.
fresh	Kevin Costner has never been more endearing than in this outing as a devoted mentor and family man.
fresh	It will make you want to sign up for a 5K immediately after...hopefully you have the endurance to finish. Or Bull Durham as your coach...
fresh	It hits all the predictable moments one might expect, but the solid acting jobs and incredible true story make "McFarland, USA" a credible sports movie that will certainly brighten your spirits.
fresh	Scrappy and stirring, it's a feel-good, underdog sports story.
fresh	Costner may be the star, but the high school athletes also shine. After all, this "based-on-a-true-story" movie is their story, too.
fresh	Yes, "McFarland USA" has the obligatory coda where we found out how everything played out for the coach and the key members of that 1987 team. You should stick around for that.
fresh	A fine family drama that's as much about shattering racial stereotypes and presenting a positive image of immigrant life as it is about Kevin Costner's coach.
fresh	Initially Costner's coach is all about ego; he may even be using the boys to land a cushy new job. And it's this unsportsmanlike conduct that makes this one of the more memorable recent sports movies.
fresh	Kevin Costner is suddenly the go-to star for tackling the country's thorniest problems on screen.
fresh	Kevin Costner never steals the spotlight from the characters who play his cross-country team in this heartwarming, character-driven film.
fresh	A "Hispanic 'Hoosiers'", and I mean that with all due respect, "McFarland, USA" is an uplifting film that hits the right notes
rotten	The latest in a long line of condescendingly inspirational sports movies about a catalog Caucasian who learns that people of other races are also capable of being decent.
rotten	What could be an inspirational teacher-student, coach-player story keeps playing the race card of simple non-whites not being able to see their own way to prosperity without a guiding white light, who in turn learns from their unsophisticated purity.
fresh	In ways large and small, McFarland USA recognizes the problems inherent in the "white savior" premise and does what it can to address them, to surprisingly affecting ends.
fresh	McFarland, USA is a refreshingly optimistic look at how Latino-American and classic WASP culture can come to a rapprochement ... it is also hamstrung by the great curse of the inspirational sports film, prioritizing its message above its story
fresh	McFarland, USA, its leading man Costner and the seven novice actors who play the story's cross-country team run their feel-good story to the finish line in inspirational style.
rotten	Despite being too long and with a totally bogus Hollywood backstory that diminishes its credibility, this is a heartwarming tale that captures the hard life of Hispanic farmworkers in California's San Joaquin Valley and Coach Jim White's amazing success.
fresh	Here's a movie that should be disposable at best, and racially condescending at worst, and yet it sticks with you. It comes by its emotions honestly and wins you over.
rotten	... gives a good effort but ultimately falls short at the finish line.
fresh	One of Kevin Costner's finest performance... A well-told story told that is full of heart
fresh	You fall for the kids playing the runners because Caro lets their souls come through in the bus rides and the race sequences and the shameless scenes of cabbage picking.
fresh	[Costner] could have sailed through this film but he gives his role an ingrained orneriness and melancholy that lifts the entire enterprise.
fresh	You'll root for these underdogs, all right, but hopefully for deeper reasons than just winning races and leaving those jerk opponents in their dust.
fresh	McFarland still pleases on the strength of good supporting work (especially Pratts) and its vivid sense of place. Costner really does anchor the film, however, with quiet, dignified work.
fresh	McFarland USA won't win any awards for originality, but it's a prime example of a proven formula done right.
fresh	Isn't always consistent, and shows strain in the editing department, but when it finds a cozy spot of empowerment and community generosity, it charms in a big way.
fresh	Inspiration is for sale in here. And though more than a spoonful of sugar is slathered over the fact-based script, the movie delivers as promised on the thrill of the race and the lump in the throat.
fresh	McFarland, USA is by-the-numbers underdogs sport fare, but good direction and performances make it a respectable addition to the genre.
rotten	From the onset, Costner plays his incorrigible character less like a modern Gary Cooper and more like a new Archie Bunker.
fresh	When McFarland, USA does the sports thing, it's just doing laps. But as an intro-level family film about Mexican-American relations, it's reasonably entertaining.
rotten	McFarland, USA is a sports movie that doesn't know what to do with the sport that serves as its focus.
fresh	While there's really not much new here (aside from playing in a sport that rarely gets the time of day in Hollywood) 'McFarland, USA' hits enough of a decent stride (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Like the runners depicted in this heartfelt sports drama, the movie itself stands out and races past other similar fare.
fresh	The quintessential Disney feel good formula picture, so just let your heart take you away
fresh	The movie can risk being patronizing, at times. And boy, is it manipulative. But all art is manipulative, in some way. And maybe being manipulated to have a little hope isn't such a bad thing after all.
rotten	It's all a bit much.
fresh	Yes, it's a bit corny and convenient at times, but there's an admiration here for hard work, ambition and battling adversity that overrides cynicism. "McFarland, USA" is a good film about good people; nothing wrong with that.
fresh	There are good things to say about the inspirational Disney sports film McFarland, USA, starting with its up-from-the-scrap-heap story, which happens to be true.
fresh	McFarland, USA quickly elevates above convention into a drama that will pull your heartstrings. It is a stunningly well crafted and inspirational film.
fresh	It's a true and simple story unencumbered by side plots, and with every character -- major and minor -- fitting neatly into place.
fresh	The strong message that "McFarland, USA" conveys about strength of character and hard work should not be overlooked or ignored.
fresh	If you think cross country might make for a boring film, it doesn't. In fact, the movie is genuinely moving.
fresh	It took a village of fine performers to depict this close-knit town. And the list is too long to give a shoutout to everyone.
fresh	The actors who play the young runners are a mixed bag of Hollywood unknowns and actual McFarland locals, all of whom are engaging.
rotten	As it is, it's an underdog story that follows the obvious track, though it should get there just fine if you're pulling for it.
fresh	McFarland USA has a distinction in that it's the rare sports movie directed by a woman. Caro's perspective is invaluable to the film's trajectory.
fresh	If you've seen the trailers, you know just how saccharine and sentimental it looks like it could be, but despite being made by Disney and being rated PG, this feel-good sports movie feels surprisingly good.
fresh	[It] aims to be rousing rather than revelatory, and it mostly succeeds.
fresh	Uplift doesn't come much better than this.
fresh	It might cross the finish line a bit winded, but overall proves more sure-footed than most of its inspirational sports-movie cousins.
fresh	Warm, sensitive performances and telling details
fresh	This culture-clash drama delivers an honest, moving story about the power individuals and communities can gain when defying expectations.
fresh	A canny combination of elements unites with an unlikely true story to make this more effective than you might be expecting.
rotten	If they gave Oscars for overcoming mechanical plotting and perfunctory dialogue, Mr. Costner would be this year's shoo-in.
fresh	While "McFarland, USA" doesn't reinvent the wheel, it does deliver in all the ways you expect that a Disney sports movie should: it's heartwarming, handsome, and features an exceptional Costner performance at its center.
rotten	Kevin Costner's signature knack for sports movies does little to buoy a stilted culture-clash dynamic.
fresh	Yes, there's a formula. Yes, it's corny. But running is about the journey, not the destination, and Disney sports movies don't know how to quit until everyone has crossed the finish line. Bless them for it.
fresh	The lovely McFarland, USA hits the expected mile markers on the inspirational-sports-movie path while slowing down enough to craft a rich portrait of a place and its inhabitants.
fresh	Based on the true story of a fledgling high school cross country team from an economically depressed Latino community, McFarland neatly delivers an uncomplicated, heartwarming message.
fresh	"McFarland, USA" invokes every underdog sports movie cliche in the book, and dammit if I didn't fall for every one.
fresh	McFarland, USA is the Million Dollar Arm of 2015: a sweet, family-friendly film that briefly tackles some important topics of race and class in America without trying too messily to give up formula and cause too much commotion.
fresh	McFarland, USA may be chock-full of inspirational sports-film cliches, but through sheer force of will (and a fine turn from Costner), it makes it to the finish line with wit and wisdom intact.
rotten	It never rises above the ordinary.
fresh	Even the best runners occasionally stumble. It's the finish that truly matters. Overall, McFarland, USA finds the perfect pacing on the strength of family and the power of hope presented against a sports backdrop.
rotten	Manipulative? Sure. Inspirational? It's all part of the formula.
fresh	actually tugs at your heartstrings - if only a bit
fresh	At this point the inspirational coach drama has become as ritualistic as the Catholic mass, but it's also developed an admirable social agenda of breaking down racial divisions, which is exemplified by this heartwarming Disney release.
rotten	You've seen feel-good football and baseball movies, plus great underdog stories of boxing, basketball, soccer and cycling. So what's left?
rotten	"McFarland, USA" invokes an old sports movie trope: the inspiring coach and his noble, suffering team. But the good intentions can't help it sprint past cliche.
fresh	It's no classic, but it's one of the better entries in the multicultural inspirational sports movie genre
fresh	It demonstrates that there's a reason Hollywood keeps turning out these inspirational sports movies: Because they work.
fresh	Caro's direction, Costner's performance and the winning cast, along with the shining of a sliver of light on the plight of field workers, however thin that sliver may be, combine to make "McFarland" a much better movie than it has any right to be.
fresh	"McFarland, USA" could have been a sentimental film, but it's not, because Caro and the screenwriters bothered to know what that they were talking about.
fresh	Based on the lives of several cross-country runners whose success story began in 1987, the script is crowded with scenes that ring true and rarely stray into conventional exposition.
fresh	The premise may sound obvious and potentially forced, but it comes off as authentic.
fresh	A less talented and more shameless director might've turned it into cornmeal mush, but Niki Caro ("Whale Rider") has delivered unto the Disney corporation a Kevin Costner sports movie that works.
fresh	Costner nails his role as Coach in this inspiring family film.
fresh	Better than you might think, thanks to strong work from Costner and a cast of fresh faces.
fresh	Inspiring, authentic proof that a legacy and a family have to start somewhere.
fresh	Kevin Costner reaches a welcome career high in this new movie, a live-action based-on-a-true-story inspirational tale of school sports, produced by Disney.
fresh	The fact that it's based on a true story makes the formula easy to swallow - and a mid-credits coda featuring the actual men at the heart of the story was one of many nice touches.
rotten	Caro keeps the material picturesque, respectful, and respectable-without crossing the line into real inspiration.
fresh	A well-made and unabashed feel-good film that has the advantage of being true. How often do you find that?
rotten	McFarland, USA is well-intentioned and largely inoffensive, but as any coach knows, good intentions aren't enough to go the distance.
rotten	Given the film's Disney stamp, you can see the feel-good coming a mile away, though the plot's never fleshed out enough to really distinguish it within the underdog-team genre.
rotten	If there's a general air of emotional authenticity woven throughout all this garden-variety, faith-in-family hokum, it's in the racing scenes.
rotten	Any filmmaker sufficiently engaged would have noticed that Maria Bello, as his alternately nagging/supportive wife, was seizing upon every last inch of a nothing role and given her something, anything to do.
fresh	Feel-good sports movies are all manipulative, but damned if Costner doesn't make this work.
fresh	Stirring even when it is manipulative, the movie hits all the expected points without finding much new to say.
rotten	McFarland, USA abides too closely to the paradigm of Disney sports dramas, becoming schmaltzy when it yearns to be inspiring.
fresh	The film's well made, well acted, and sometimes beautiful.
fresh	The real underdog story is how this by-the-numbers film about cross-cultural friendship, tenacity and strong work managed to go the distance without my rolling my eyes too heavily. Coach Blanco did all right.
fresh	An exciting sports film that also stands as an emotionally rich depiction of community, sharing, and generosity.
fresh	While the beats of the story are often stock, the picture benefits from sensitive direction by New Zealander Niki Caro and from a most appealing performance by Kevin Costner.
fresh	Poignant story about Latino runners a winner for families.
fresh	McFarland, USA is basically the movie you expect it to be, with the caveat that it's a pretty good variation of said movie.
fresh	A feel-good movie that earns all those good feelings, "McFarland, USA" might be running on a predetermined track, but the heart it shows along the journey is what makes it a winner.
rotten	McFarland, USA risks nothing and, therefore, ultimately achieves little.
fresh	Where the picture excels is as a straightforward sports drama, and Caro delivers the satisfactions of the genre with unfussy verve.
fresh	
rotten	...the film's few sparks of originality and charisma are stamped out by a script and a director who refuses to take any genuine chances with the subject material.
rotten	The film, which runs a scant 83 minutes (and that includes the opening and closing credits), feels like it's just getting going when it abruptly ends.
rotten	Very little life here.
fresh	The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again.
rotten	...a thoroughly unmemorable and disappointingly lazy horror endeavor.
rotten	This sub-par scare-flick entry in the "back from the dead" genre starts smart but gets dumber as it goes.
rotten	If hell, as the movie says, is the worst memory of your life on an infinite loop, I'd better clean up my act or I'll be watching The Lazarus Effect for all eternity.
fresh	It's thematically thin but competently made and good for a few scares.
rotten	The picture is in desperate need of a personality, a perspective, something that justifies its existence.
rotten	The fright ultimately fizzles...
rotten	The first truly awful horror film of 2015... Only one aspect of the film is good on any level: Olivia Wilde is absolutely splendid.
rotten	...settles into a ho-hum slasher groove, offering up with Pavlovian regularity epileptic freak-outs and shadowy figures.
rotten	The film's only shock is that it was helmed by David Gelb, who made the wonderful 2011 doc Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Raising the question: Now that Gelb's career is officially dead, will he have better luck than Duplass' character in bringing it back to life?
rotten	Despite an intriguing opening and an overqualified cast, The Lazarus Effect can't shake a been-there/resurrected-that vibe.
rotten	Ms. Wilde could hold our attention needlepointing the Periodic Table, but having our dream fulfilled to see her go all 'Carrie' couldn't breathe life into this misfire.
rotten	This isn't a journey, it's a funeral procession.
rotten	And just when things are poised to get interesting, the movie goes nowhere really, really fast.
rotten	Lovely Olivia Wilde gets so many extreme close-ups that you feel like her dermatologist. She winds up looking like those outer-space pictures of dead moons.
fresh	The concepts in this film are not terribly new, but they are effectively presented.
rotten	The Lazarus Effect is one of those horror films where lack of character logic makes it hard to root for the bodies that are inevitably going to pile the floor.
rotten	How do you get from Jiro Dreams of Sushi to Jiro Dreams of Reanimated Sushi?
rotten	I would have loved to see more from the filmmakers, daring to fail while staking out some new terror incognita instead of just going through the motions of an experiment for which we already have the results.
rotten	A grimy, dopey, confused thriller that wastes a very likable cast.
rotten	Death may not be the end in The Lazarus Effect, but it should be.
rotten	Despite a good cast and a short running time, Blumhouse Productions' latest micro-budget pic doesn't have the alluring franchise pull of some of its other films.
rotten	A far cheaper cousin to 'Flatliners' that, thanks to the better-than-average cast, is reasonably engaging for the first hour or so before deteriorating badly in a mayhem-filled finale.
rotten	The story is dismayingly ordinary and its execution by director David Gelb is virtually devoid of invention.
rotten	Unfortunately, the film ultimately peters out rather than coming to a satisfactorily disquieting conclusion.
rotten	The movie anxiously, recklessly rushes through its plot toward the climax, as if it's afraid of anyone noticing its emptiness.
rotten	If you get your horror jollies from sneaky blind-side pan shots accompanied by 165dB blasts, you'll love The Lazarus Effect. But these cheap, cheap, CHEAP moments punctured my eardrums...
rotten	"The Lazarus Effect" boasts nothing special. It's not going to provide much relief for horror-starved audiences.
rotten	If you slammed the heads of Lucy and Carrie together, The Lazarus Effect would be the messy aftermath left on the ground.
rotten	"The Lazarus Effect" is nothing but a cheap horror film cloaked in scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	The first half of this film is the best, with the actors reciting the technical gibberish very convincingly, while trying to resuscitate a dog named Rocky. The second half is essentially conventional horror stuff we've seen before with this genre.
rotten	Another cheapie from the producers of "Paranormal Activity." Aims low, but hits its target.
rotten	The Lazarus Effect starts dead and cannot be raised from it.
rotten	This isn't a real horror movie-this is the kind of horror movie that the characters in a real horror movie watch in order to comment on the lameness of the genre before their authentic terrors begin.
rotten	A low-rent rip-off of Flatliners. The talented cast is wasted.
rotten	The Lazarus Effect does have one redeeming quality. It ends quickly.
rotten	No resurrection for this dog please.
rotten	Mildly enjoyable despite its basic mediocrity ...
rotten	The Lazarus Effect begins with an intriguing premise then proceeds to squander all the early goodwill through a slow, inexorable descent into cheap horror gimmicks.
rotten	The flick simply isn't good, be that from a scientific, moral or just a way to raise goose bumps standpoint. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	A tense, efficient medical thriller best enjoyed sans microscope.
rotten	While The Lazarus Effect isn't the worst scary movie film you'll see this year, it is probably one of the most predictable and lazily plotted.
rotten	Although it does stagger and groan and stumble around, you wouldn't necessarily say it's alive.
rotten	It staggers, zombielike, from one jump-scare to another before petering out, a scant 83 minutes after rising from the slab.
rotten	For a film that has pulled a reasonably overqualified cast with solid dramatic chops, it is regretfully short on any characters that stick out in any way whatsoever.
rotten	The movie ends up being like Frankenstein's monster before the lightning shock -- it's a lot of pieces sewn together that are lifeless.
rotten	[A] risible mix of pseudoscientific hokum and supernatural freakouts.
rotten	[I]t's not too much to expect that, if a movie is going to ask the big questions, it at least follow through in exploring them with some degree of curiosity.
rotten	Doesn't go far enough, isn't scary enough and has mad scientists who just aren't mad enough.
rotten	I'm placing all of the blame on the script and filmmaking, but that's because the actors can only do so much with what they're given.
rotten	Bringing someone back from the dead is one of the horror genre's oldest and most effective tropes, but with "The Lazarus Effect," it just seems tired.
rotten	There are lessons to be learned from this minimalist thriller. The first is that scaring people requires more than just tossing furniture around, turning the lights off and on, and basically sneaking up from behind and shouting "Boo!"
rotten	Who knew that playing God would be so unfulfilling... or so dull.
rotten	Like too many horror films, this one seems targeted at a hypothetical audience using only 10 percent of its brainpower.
rotten	It would be difficult to care less about all this.
rotten	The film intends to explore the nature and mystery of death, but devolves into a combination of trivial science fiction and banal "Pet Sematary" havoc.
rotten	Looks like it was directed by a blind and deaf person over a weekend on a leftover laboratory set from a TV show and edited with a roulette wheel.
fresh	Absorbing, well-crafted and appropriately tense, with a smart cast that raises it a notch above average.
rotten	It's Re-Animator with a little bit of Flatliners and a whole lot of yawns.
fresh	...it's a B-movie that manages to be more than a potboiler.
rotten	This is an 83-minute movie that feels a half hour longer and, if it weren't for the loud crescendos, it would put people to sleep.
rotten	The fear in the middle section that everything may get very, very, very stupid - which it will, and how - is more terrifying than any of the lame kills.
rotten	You've seen it all before. The only question is: Why haven't they?
rotten	The Lazarus Effect is a wag-the-dog film, where the filmmakers had a good idea of how to end the movie, but didn't put the required work into selling the setup.
rotten	Why play down to the basest tenets of a genre when it's clear the filmmaking aspires to something smarter?
rotten	Mark Duplass and Olivia Wilde struggle to breathe life into a recycled thriller about the horrors of reanimation.
fresh	The Lazarus Effect doesn't exactly break new ground, but it nonetheless finds plenty to relish in the mouldering bits it stitches together as it gives classic themes about death, life and the soul a literal and figurative shot in the arm.
rotten	It's not eat-your-ticket-stub bad, but "The Lazarus Effect" doesn't work at all, perhaps most successful at putting the audience to sleep.
rotten	This stuff was tired 20 years ago.
rotten	The film squanders whatever potential it had, not to mention the talents of such performers as Duplass and Wilde who clearly deserve better.
fresh	As predictable as The Lazarus Effect may be, it's a well-crafted and effective horror film.
rotten	You've seen this movie before with peppier actors, and not tethered to a visually uninteresting set that looks like a remainder from a 10-year-old episode of CSI.
rotten	"This is too much weird s---!" declares one victim-to-be, as if he were writing this review instead of me.
rotten	There is a crafty, creepy, provocative film lurking inside of "The Lazarus Effect," but, alas, it never comes out to play.
rotten	David Gelb doesn't evince so much as a single compositional sleight of hand, merely delighting in turning lights on and off and watching Zoe appear in random places.
fresh	I don't expect reinvention of the wheel, as long as a movie rolls along well enough. And this one does.
fresh	Unsurprising, but chilling, well-played and very well-executed revive-the-dead horror thriller.
fresh	Mainly just a film to showcase how utterly talented Mae Whitman is.
fresh	You don't need to be Einstein to see where this is going, but it's an enjoyable and occasionally very funny trip, with some smart observations about the yoof's addiction to technology.
fresh	The DUFF may have some snappy, modern dialogue that young people will get a kick out of, but it's the film's incredibly charming leads who make it entertaining.
fresh	Even if The DUFF doesn't raise the bar for recent teen romps, it allows Whitman and Amell to show off their considerable charms.
fresh	The teen-movie standard about the struggles of the high school outsider is given a good, surprisingly thoughtful going over in an above-average offering that challenges stereotypes and the alleged importance of fitting in.
fresh	Mildly amusing but always well acted.
fresh	Mae Whitman - please star in all movies.
fresh	Astute and genuinely funny teen comedies don't come along very often; this one starts with a smart script and lets the spirited cast run with it...
fresh	The smartest, sweetest, wittiest high-school movie in years.
fresh	Based on the 2010 YA novel by Kody Keplinger, The DUFF is a moderately astute, consistently entertaining teen comedy about the evils of social-media shaming and the healing power of just being yourself.
fresh	The DUFF is a heartfelt film that adheres somewhat to formula, but that's distinguished by its knowingness, Josh A Cagan's smart script and by a riotous central performance from Whitman.
fresh	This high-school comedy avoids the worst cliches of the genre and resists rather than indulges the worst tendencies of adolescence. Which is a rare thing.
fresh	The once-ubiquitous American high school comedy has been supplanted by dystopian Young Adult franchises in recent years, but it makes a minor and surprisingly welcome comeback with The Duff.
fresh	The DUFF is the first laugh-out-loud high school comedy since Easy A while also being genuinely the kind of story young girls need to be told more often.
fresh	I think the selfie generation has just got it's own The Breakfast Club.
fresh	Yes, it uses a well-worn textbook but thanks to some quality casting and a likeable screenplay from writer Josh Cagan, there are still plenty of laughs.
fresh	Mean Girls it ain't, but then again, what is?
rotten	A formulaic comedy where the actors appear to be a good 10 years older than the characters they are playing.
fresh	While this latest entry into the Pygmalion with Clearasil genre doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's still fun enough to hang out with for a while.
fresh	This is a likeable and smartly written teen movie that still seems very fresh in spite of rehashing characters and situations familiar from countless other high-school comedies.
fresh	The Duff is your typical high-school misfit comedy, elevated by a kooky, cranky and deeply sympathetic performance by Mae Whitman.
rotten	[The DUFF] looks at first as if it's set in a post-clique world, where it's ok to be niche. But no, the film tells us, for jock, goth and geek alike, there's another hurdle: you need to be hot.
fresh	The Duff is a standard-issue high-school film, but it has some funny material.
fresh	This tongue-in-cheek endeavour is playful in its approach, never earnest enough to a point where it's unbearable.
fresh	A predictable prom-com, but the journey is fun.
fresh	While definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, fans of the genre can be sure to leave more than satisfied after the credits roll.
fresh	Mae Whitman... [is] absolutely terrific, giving a wry, knowing attitude to her character and the film, and turning The DUFF from a modestly amusing comedy to a genuine success.
rotten	This is a well-intentioned and sometimes quite sharp high school movie that falls just short of the mark due to a few way-off-the-mark scenes and too much heavy-handed preaching.
fresh	Subversively snarky, yet sensitive, it updates George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" with 21st century technology.
fresh	distinguished by sprightly, intelligent writing, and outstanding performances that are not just funny, but also perceptive and nuanced.
fresh	Perhaps no one over age 16 should ever see this movie. That may not be the worst advice I could give you.
rotten	Although it has its John Hughes-esque moments, 'The DUFF' is derivative of lots of other, and more recent, teen angst movies.
fresh	The DUFF has a lot to say about beauty ideals and how we perceive our self-worth.
fresh	Will...[strike a chord] with teen girls, if they can get past the casting of the healthy, but hardly plus-sized Whitman, as well as the changes made to sanitize the book...
fresh	Even if it serves up the happy ending audiences apparently insist upon, the good in The DUFF mostly outweighs the stuff you've seen before.
fresh	Funny, heartfelt and inspirational. The best high school comedy since Easy A. Mae Whitman deserves to be a star.
fresh	It's hard not to see "The Duff" becoming an instant teen classic.
rotten	The half-hearted message about inner beauty and self-esteem becomes muddled in a film that winds up as shallow as many of its characters.
fresh	The Duff makes timely points about self-love, body image, and modern relationships but falls short of becoming a teen drama classic.
rotten	Anyone not currently in high school is bound to find it derivative, albeit not unpleasant.
fresh	The DUFF won me over, to the degree that I found it to be one of the more charming teen comedies of recent years.
rotten	As much as the film attempts to follow in the Easy A template, it lacks its satiric edge, and its willingness to confront high school hypocrisy head-on.
fresh	One of the few teen comedies that may remain relevant (and entertaining) for years to come.
fresh	Why is it so wonderful? Because wit and charm matter, and The DUFF has a good deal of both. The cast will be stars, the gags will be immortal, and you'll still be watching this movie years from now.
fresh	Fun high school comedy is unexpectedly insightful.
rotten	Yearning to be the new "Mean Girls," "The DUFF" is just another bad movie some premium cable channel is going to try to make you watch in the near future.
fresh	Teen angst flicks are always formula. The DUFF is no exception. Once in awhile one is done right. This is a pretty good -- but very predictable -- flick.
rotten	The fact that The DUFF ends on a such a sappy, uninspired note isn't surprising, but it is disappointing given all the little glimmers of promise peppered throughout the film's first half.
rotten	[T]oo eager to prove that it's hip to the ways of the youngsters these days ... pounding away at its one note of supposed insight until it just becomes condescending.
fresh	The chemistry between Whitman and Amell is decent enough to overcome some issues and rough spots. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Whitman displays flawless comic timing and consistently makes inspiring choices in terms of delivery, reaction, even the slightest facial expression. She shines confidently in a self-deprecating role, and it's irresistible.
rotten	More in line with cheesy nineties teen movies like SHE'S ALL THAT than John Hughes or more sensitive, recent fare.
fresh	It's not "Mean Girls." It's not even "Easy A." But it's definitely a solid B.
fresh	It's the first great teen comedy since Mean Girls.
fresh	Sandel's film has heart, some good laughs and a decent message. In this age of cyberbullying, that's nothing to scoff at.
rotten	It falls short of the mark, even as it hits every one of the genre's conventions.
fresh	Capable, spry, and mostly wise when it isn't spelling out its moralistic intent. The main attraction is Mae Whitman, acting her heart out while making her every last moment look as natural and vulnerable as that of a real life being lived.
fresh	Especially because the young co-stars Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell are so appealing, The DUFF is charming, cheeky and relevant.
fresh	Where Bianca and Wesley are going is obvious from the outset, but it builds naturally through a pal-ship with a genuine spark.
rotten	Even in this would-be subversive comedy, success means getting the guy.
rotten	Romance, or the desire to find someone special, isn't a bad thing - if it's not the only thing. But as it stands in "DUFF," the denouement at prom has cliche written all over it.
fresh	The DUFF would make John Hughes smile.
rotten	The film deposits its heroine and everyone in the audience looking toward her for image-maintaining guidance back at square one.
rotten	A tepid, undernourished clone of the John Hughes high school template, with attractive leads stuck in a script that feels like a tattered hand-me-down.
fresh	Whitman makes Bianca so thoroughly herself throughout that anyone would be glad to have her for a BFF.
rotten	A Derivative Unimaginative Forgettable Film.
rotten	Mae Whitman is the best thing here, and the funny actress deserves better material than what's offered in this derivative and superficial ode to teen self-acceptance.
rotten	The earnest, yet consistently misfiring "The DUFF," makes all those other teen movies look even better.
fresh	A smart, funny, straight-talking teen movie in the John Hughes tradition. Oodles of charm from the young cast.
fresh	It works, but just barely.
fresh	While ultimately serving up the expected, The DUFF is fresh and funny throughout, largely thanks to two vibrantly written lead characters.
fresh	The movie is glib and willfully superficial but also smart at times about teen social stratification.
fresh	For all its potential pitfalls, The DUFF manages to keep its head above water, thanks to Whitman, Amell, and a willingness to engage with teen-movie cliches in a relatively thoughtful way.
fresh	There are no surprises here, but the predictability doesn't mute the fun.
fresh	The ostensible message of accepting difference is overwhelmed by a spirit of blind conformism.
fresh	The DUFF is exponentially dumb. For starters, Mae Whitman isn't fat or ugly. Point of fact, she's wildly charismatic.
rotten	"The DUFF" is a Dumb, Uninteresting, Formulaic Failure.
rotten	Whitman is fantastic, the movie is not- it goes back and forth between subverting genre cliches and wholeheartedly embracing them
rotten	You know what would be revolutionary? Making a really good movie about a three-dimensional teenage female character that doesn't start and finish with both eyes on the same old punishing character types.
rotten	What might have been a frank portrayal of high school culture and challenges ends up veering between being either too cynically hyper-sexual or preachy.
fresh	"Mae Whitman reveals herself to be one of the funniest actresses of her generation in a spot-on and endlessly quotable take on teenage 'dramz' in 2015."
fresh	This is [Whitman's] film, and she seems determined not to waste her chance at being a leading lady.
rotten	Whitman brings such kindness to Bianca that the movie almost sometimes sort of works as empowering evidence of many teens' flawed, self-esteem-driven perspectives.
rotten	A shallow, witless, and bizarrely cast endeavor, always eager to preach about the value of self-acceptance, but just as ready to indulge superficial behavior as a method of empowerment.
fresh	A clever comedy that isn't a chore to sit through if you're outside of the target demographic. Oh, and your kids are gonna love it.
fresh	It's a comedy with an easy message, and it's sort of sweet. Not too raunchy, not too challenging. A good date movie for sophomores.
rotten	The DUFF doesn't seem to know what its point actually is. It's pro-self-acceptance and also pro-makeover. It's about liking yourself, and how you'd like yourself better with a boyfriend.
rotten	Feels like grown-ups so desperate to appear hip to social media, they make sure to mention every app they've ever heard of, including We Heart It and Whatsapp.
fresh	The DUFF doesn't deviate much from the pattern, in fact it doesn't stray from it all, but a pair of playful lead performances by Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell makes it a worthy entry in the genre.
fresh	The DUFF won't stay with you far past its runtime. But as a vehicle, it's ample proof that we should be seeing more of Mae Whitman.
fresh	Most of the credit goes to Whitman, who stands in, and stands up, for the DUFF in all of us.
fresh	This winsome comedy is a little low in the stakes department, not to mention predictable, but it gets an "A" for charm.
rotten	Derivative of better teen comedies and not daring enough to deal with the consequences of an image-based culture, The DUFF wastes a talented young ensemble.
fresh	There are stretches in which The Duff soars, nailing scene after funny scene with an honest spirit rarely seen in mainstream teen films.
fresh	Formulaic, sure -- but cute, sassy and quick...just edgy enough to work
fresh	Its central pair of unlikely allies will engage young audiences' sympathy. They're smartly played by Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell, whose warmth and comic chops keep the movie buoyant.
fresh	While it's neither as biting as Mean Girls nor as sweetly referential as Easy A, the earnest and sometimes amusing The DUFF is a fine addition to the canon.
fresh	I laughed a few times and despite some guy-a-mile-away plot moments, walked away feeling just fine about it. And from a jaded film snob, that's a very good sign.
rotten	It's pretend bondage. Caffeine-free Diet BDSM.
rotten	It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but in this case, only because this movie is better than its source material doesn't mean it's good.
rotten	If they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by David Duchovny, the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a long-lost episode of Red Shoe Diaries.
rotten	Johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part, but even with a listenable soundtrack, the song that most comes to mind is Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?"
fresh	Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable.
fresh	Without the baggage of having read the book, the synopsis or even the film's Wikipedia page, Fifty Shades of Grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety, concepts of consent and, ultimately, power.
rotten	A monumentally boring motion picture.
rotten	Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration.
fresh	... isn't nearly as terrible as E.L. James' novel would make you expect. There's perverted, like the sado-masochistic sex games played by tycoon Christian Grey, and then there's perverse, like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted.
rotten	Basically, they made a lousy, mid-2000s-era Katherine Heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar cliches.
rotten	A syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue.
rotten	My biggest grip with the film was that I didn't find the two leading characters all that interesting.
rotten	He's a wealthy tycoon named Gray who takes a woman to her limits. I'm talking, of course, about '9 1/2 Weeks.'
rotten	Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades - and that they're not real.
rotten	One suspects that Taylor-Johnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation, and the film's lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments.
fresh	What emerges in Fifty Shades of Grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point.
fresh	Taylor-Johnson has made a film that is both sexy and stylish.
rotten	I fault no one for whatever it is that gets their crank turning, but if this movie is working you need to take that thing out for a spin far more often.
rotten	It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to.
rotten	I can only say that boredom set in early.
rotten	While there's some meat to Dakota Johnson's role of the ingenue, Jamie Dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film.
rotten	In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame.
rotten	The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit.
rotten	What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'
rotten	Oh...my...god.
rotten	Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove. Even the film's raw sex appeal is lacking, which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue.
rotten	...a lukewarm exercise in timidity that - if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter - is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it.
fresh	"Fifty Shades of Grey," which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark, may not be the film some of the book's readers were hoping to witness.
rotten	There is a very good chance that I will see nothing worse all year. I'm pretty sure I will see nothing more brain-witheringly stupid and boring -- or less sexy.
rotten	The movie is simply a profitable pop culture movement with the only good thing coming out of it is Beyonce's remix of 'Crazy in Love.'
rotten	If this fanchise plans on being the "Saw" of Valentine's Day, I hope the next installment doesn't torture the audience so much.
rotten	This is a film that should have gone direct to Cinemax.
rotten	Fifty Shades the movie seems destined to inspire more eye-rolling than lip-biting, even if there's no denying that its protagonist is better served by the film than the book.
rotten	Think of it as the "Downton Abbey" of bondage, designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination.
rotten	A wimpy, wounded billionaire sadist - correction "dominant" - with a cleanliness fetish and no friends stalks with gifts a passive-aggressive virgin.
fresh	It realizes this story is ridiculous in ways the book itself never could. It has an actual sense of humor.
rotten	It's supposed to be a romance, but plays like a long, boring business meeting in which the naughtiest bits are raised not in the bedroom, but the boardroom, where contract negotiation stagger on over the proposed merger of his manacles to her wrists.
rotten	This adaptation of EL James's BDSM potboiler struggles to make a spanking cinematic silk purse out of its notoriously tin-eared source.
rotten	A charm-free hero with control issues and a passive, fretful heroine have coy and tediously vanilla pretend-sex. This is meant to be erotic?
rotten	Panders to Twilight's housewives and teens demo using that story's template, but with sex! Kinky sex! The sex is incredibly boring and the alleged "romance" between a naive college student and her stalkerish zillionaire suitor is deeply troubling
fresh	As silly and, yes, sanctimonious as this adaptation is, it deserves mention as one of the first major studio releases in ages to promote sex over vigilante violence or superherodom ... And that, in a peculiar way, makes the film a refreshing departure.
rotten	A desultory dud, that swaps out [the novel's] prolonged and explicit intercourse for tame (conceived as tasteful) inserts, padded out by the troubled relationship between a straw man and blow up virgin.
rotten	Beneath its curious surface, "Fifty Shades of Grey" is an uninformed and unrealistic "romance" set in the BDSM world that dangerously dramatizes sexual violence and glamorizes domestic abuse.
rotten	I expect most viewers would rather see the filmmakers take this franchise in a different direction. How about Fifty Shades of The Grey, with the two vapid protagonists forced to contend with Liam Neeson and a pack of ravenous wolves?
rotten	Such silliness.
rotten	A monochromatic misfire featuring only one shade: blushing pink.
rotten	Frankly, after watching the film, I felt ambivalent. The film's not exhausting, at least. It's not quite fifty shades of dreck.
fresh	Perfectly capturing the tone of E.L. James' sensational best-selling novel, this tale of control, sex and submission is tantalizing, titillating and provocative
rotten	Part of the appeal of the tawdry romance novel is that the visuals are left to the imagination for its legions of fans, whose expectations for steam and sizzle will inevitably be left unfulfilled here.
rotten	It's an episode of Red Shoe Diaries with a major studio budget. It's a Lifetime movie with insider art pretensions. A Harlequin romance with anal play.
rotten	It's been said that the movie contains 20 minutes of sex; if this is the case, it must contain at least 40 minutes of Ana biting her lip or putting a pencil in her mouth.
rotten	There's no escape from the silly, pulpy predictability of Fifty Shades of Grey.
rotten	The best they can do for dirty talk sounds like 'wear the panties your mother laid out for you.'
rotten	Presumably the sequels will explore forbidden taboos like "character development" and "plot."
rotten	A cynical, perfunctorily directed, guileless, sexless and artless re-tread of the novel - the worst kind of fan, and potential franchise, service.
fresh	A relatively chaste, arguably feminist interpretation of the BDSM fairy tale.
rotten	"Fifty Shades of Grey" has turned out to be more like 50 shades of blah.
fresh	The sex scenes merely serve as a basis for the real appeal of the film, that is, the shifting emotions and back-and-forth of "who's got the edge?"
rotten	[I]t promotes female "empowerment" within the safe culturally approved traditional female roles as submissive and as seeking a powerful Prince Charming to rescue them from "ordinary" lives.
rotten	Still not bad for being based on a book with a narrator who exclaims "jeez" while in the throes of orgasm and talks about her "bottom" like she's a 4-year-old.
rotten	Who would have imagined that a movie about sex could be so boring?
fresh	Anastasia Steele becomes a woman. Christian Grey? Bimbo. It's a gorgeous conceit, and I can't wait to read a raft of writing by smart female essayists about the film, and its cheeky subversion of its tin-eared source material.
rotten	Unfortunately for the Fifty Shades of Grey movie, a solid cast, good director and unique premise only help to expose the inherent weaknesses of the source novel.
rotten	Less interested in sexual power dynamics than in lassoing this guy into what the movie perceives as "normalcy."
rotten	The film doesn't culminate in anything. It's a bunch of scenes that end before any kind of satisfying conclusion.
rotten	There really isn't enough meat here to cobble together a real movie, but you can't blame Taylor-Johnson for not trying. She somehow gives it all a movie-type sheen.
rotten	If soft core porn is your thing go for it but that's about all you'll get. Not a lot of grey matter used writing the script of Fifty Shades of Grey.
rotten	I guess what I found to be so surprising is how a movie about weird, erotic, passionate sex could wind up being so dull.
rotten	Were it not based on a massive best-seller, no one would have made such a thematically reprehensible movie. If you think rape is a turn-on, this is the film for you. Personally, I'm perfectly happy not to be included in your ranks.
rotten	Attempts to capture the appeal of a classical Victorian romance - tragedy and all - but has neither the complexity nor the historical context necessary to live up to its ambition.
rotten	Thelanguage of 50 Shades is actually of the financial deal and the job interview, replete with the kind of counter-intuitive sloganeering we hear in advertisements. So much of what Christian Grey says is what money would say if it could talk.
rotten	Every line of dialogue is loaded. Loaded like a diaper.
rotten	An Ambien pill...While a follow-up is likely, it's a bit presumptuous, and if it's anything like the first installment, it's about as welcome as a splintered paddle.
rotten	What's worse than the boring sex scenes, however, is the rest of the boring movie.
rotten	Bland and dull, except for the rare moments when it is unintentionally hilarious, all Fifty Shades has to teach the curious is that it doesn't matter how many shades of grey you use, you will just end up with a drab, colorless blob.
fresh	Given the constraints and need to please its considerable fan-base, this sleek, fairly trim and occasionally sensual adaptation is the best imaginable outcome.
rotten	Lackluster take on best seller is way too graphic for kids.
fresh	It is unashamed tosh but at least director Sam Taylor-Johnson has fashioned it into tosh with a touch of class.
rotten	Like some mutant spawn of THE BACHELOR
rotten	Yawnography.
rotten	Neither a camp laughing stock nor a shocking study of sexual obsession, Fifty Shades Of Grey starts well but fumbles in the dark. See it for Dakota Johnson. For the rest, find your safe word.
rotten	Absolutely ludicrous, dramatically clumsy, fifty shades of wrong, but...If audiences can cool their loins long enough, they may have a productive think about the nature of their desires...
rotten	Sleek sets, sadomasochism, a few spankings and an overall blandness
fresh	...a passable adaptation that could (and should) have been much better...
rotten	"Grey" has about as much steam as a day-old cup of Earl Grey. The sexual scenes are ordinary and fail to push the envelope; they definitely do not arouse any viewer.
fresh	After all the hype, it's impossible not to expect steam from this adaptation of E.L. James' mommy-porn bestseller
rotten	In the annals of sexually-charged event cinema, "Fifty Shades of Grey" barely lights a candle let alone combusts with unbridled forbidden passion.
rotten	Fifty Shades of Grey may be the first film in history made specifically for the purposes of hate-watching.
rotten	To put it plainly, there's nothing redeeming here - not the acting, writing, directing or even the, um, "action" scenes, during which you just feel bad for the characters, actors and everyone on the set who had to be a part of them.
rotten	Hopeless twaddle, but sleekly made and sometimes funny. An honorable effort, and better than it needed to be.
rotten	It's a bland experience occasionally interrupted by bouts of nudity and related naughty bits. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Although Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan lack erotic chemistry, this fetishistic fantasy remains faithful to the provocative novel.
fresh	Will you sign the necessary paperwork to enjoy Fifty Shades of Grey?
fresh	... had James been overruled more often Fifty Shades of Grey could have been something genuinely extraordinary: an adult blockbuster in every sense.
rotten	If this was written by Adam Sandler, groups of offended ladies would be outside theaters protesting with pitchforks and torches. Also, we wouldn't be laughing as much.
rotten	"50 Shades" has its sexy moments, but never attempts to be romantic, and isn't ambitious enough to deliver romance and sex appeal simultaneously. ...Jamie Dornan is given the thankless task of playing a monotone misogynist.
rotten	Nobody sweats or pants or experiences onscreen ecstasy, which is presumably how a movie about violent sex manages to avoid an NC-17 rating, but the result feels like 50 shades of beige.
rotten	Isn't the stuff of bondage and discipline, sexual role play, silky blindfolds, and whips and floggers supposed to be, well, exciting?
fresh	My mind screams Noooooooo! This movie sucks and is offensive on so many different levels, but damn my lady parts....Jamie Dornan's abs beat me into submission. Every time I think about them any common sense I have goes out the window.
rotten	Fifty Shades of Grey is by no means a masterpiece. Yet there are moments where it rises above the material thanks to the lovely Dakota Johnson who is luminous, and a director that helps paint a very pretty picture.
rotten	Fifty Shades isn't ha-ha cheesy fun. It isn't tee-hee quasi-dirty fun. It's terrible. On almost every level.
rotten	Fifty Shades of Grey only has one shade: tedious self-pity. The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel.
rotten	I have seen more heat and more skin in late-night offerings on Cinemax. I've seen more realistic romance in young-adult movies, and I've seen better acting by furniture.
rotten	How can a movie this controversial be this painfully boring?
rotten	While the movie talks dirty, what materializes on the screen is soft focus and barely soft core.
rotten	Advertises itself as edgy and titillating, but proves fatally tepid and boring.
rotten	Jamie Dornan is going to get crushed for his performance here, but it's not all his fault. His character, as it's written, has the charm of a toaster. There's not much Dornan can do about that.
fresh	Johnson has a natural warmth, intelligence, and humor that come across on screen and go a long way toward making the movie less silly than it could have been.
rotten	Anastasia is a problem. Christian is one, too. We spend most of the movie trying to figure out which character is the bigger one.
rotten	We're constantly told in life that women long for humor, tenderness and honesty, yet that doesn't seem to be the case here.
rotten	Dornan simply doesn't have the ability to truly offer up deep, unimaginable pain and self-loathing. He's just not that talented an actor, and if the part were recast for the next two movies, no one would bat a blindfolded eye.
rotten	A generic romance cynically engineered to appeal to the lowest common denominator of female fantasy.
rotten	Johnson is rather sweet, though, and if she played a role that required her to look more than alternately smitten and poleaxed, she could score big. But now that Fifty Shades is poised to be a franchise, will she have that chance?
rotten	Johnson does a lot of moaning and groaning...leading me to visualize a director wearing plus fours with a megaphone...out of camera range, yelling, "Moan!" and "Groan!" The idea of sitting through two sequels is almost more than one can bear.
fresh	The director of the much-anticipated adaptation, Sam Taylor-Johnson, made what could have been a trashy TV movie into well-conceived cinema.
rotten	...director Sam Taylor-Johnson attempts to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but while she leavens the experience with some well mined character humor and gives the production a glossy sheen, you can only put so much lipstick on a pig.
rotten	Yet the film's biggest problem is its two stars. Despite all the ripped abs and exposed breasts, blindfolds and cuffs, there are few sparks between them. Without that, Fifty Shades of Grey feels as cold and sterile as Grey's sleek penthouse.
rotten	Those who take their significant others to see it this Valentine's Day may find the evening ends with a soft kiss on the cheek rather than a night full of boot knockin'.
rotten	Confunde fetiche com abuso.
fresh	Sam Taylor-Johnson's Fifty Shades of Grey is total trash. Noble trash. The amusing kind of trash, actually.
rotten	as exciting as a rectal exam
rotten	No one said the masochism part of the story in Fifty Shades of Grey had to do with what the audience would be put through.
rotten	The dashes of momentum are just a tease. It's hard to remember the last time this much sex was this tedious.
fresh	I'll go see the next movie quite happily.
rotten	Sam Taylor-Johnson's film version is neither as bad as it could have been nor as good as it needs to be.
rotten	Actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan make an appealing couple and battle mightily against the flat, linear plotting, though when the story ended inconclusively I wasn't eager to follow them through the inevitable sequels.
rotten	In the interest of consumer reporting, I'll say this: The book isn't better than the movie, and the film isn't better than the book.
rotten	Oddly enough, Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie version of E.L. James' phenomenal sexy best-seller begins as an intriguing, exciting, even eroticizing experience before its S&M engine jumps the rails.
rotten	[A] supremely silly film.
rotten	In the end, there's nothing here we haven't seen before. But there's also nothing as agonizingly awkward as James's prose.
fresh	Some aspects might be off-putting, but the actors and filmmakers handle the topic in a surprisingly tasteful way.
rotten	Leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, both of whom spend the majority of the film supposedly desperately longing for each other, have so little chemistry that it gives the sexy goings-on a rather clinical feel.
fresh	A great movie? Not even close. Is it the best movie that could have been made from its source material? It probably is.
rotten	A flaccid S and M movie that's more infuriating than titillating? Happy Valentine's Day.
rotten	"Fifty Shades of Grey" doesn't entertainingly cross the line of good taste so much as trip and fall on it.
rotten	The likably coy Johnson has no chemistry with the dreary, self-serious Dornan. He's a casting disaster ...
rotten	The sex scenes are the best bit because the story is so abjectly terrible.
rotten	The biggest disappointment for those non-readers of the book is the feeling of is-that-all-there-is? A bit of rope, some hanging around, six smacks - it's tame enough to make Tyrion Lannister of Game of Thrones smirk.
rotten	All in all, this is really tame.
fresh	The movie as glossy as a Topps trading card. Real BDSM enthusiasts will roll their eyes at its chaste exploitation. But it's got something going on.
fresh	When you look at is as nothing more than horny housewife erotic fiction, it serves its purpose.
rotten	"Fifty Shades of Grey" the movie, for the record, is not quite as bad as "Fifty Shades of Grey" the book. But that's not saying much.
rotten	Fifty Shades of Grey only has one shade: tedious self-pity. The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel.
rotten	In the closing moments, "Shades" goes from being dull to disturbing, but only slightly.
rotten	Sam Taylor-Johnson's drably competent adaptation of EL James's appalling mucky novel offers Nitrazepam for the libido throughout.
rotten	While Fifty Shades Of Grey is a memorable and society-shifting cultural event, it's in no way a memorable movie.
fresh	Despite what you might fear, the movie is not torture. And even if it doesn't inspire lust, you will breathe a warm sigh of relief, thinking: This could have been so much worse.
rotten	Creating a genteel R-rated film from a very X-rated book is like making a Mamma Mia! movie without the songs.
rotten	"Fifty Shades of Grey" should be fun and frisky and, most of all, hot. Instead, it is a reserved, sanitized, overinflated downer, as sterile as Christian's sleek luxury penthouse.
rotten	Unofficially titled, So, Can I Spank You or What?, Grey leaves you with a question you don't want to ask after a movie or after sex: Is that it?
rotten	About an hour in, it finally dawned on me that perhaps the movie was giving me insights into masochism after all. As the minutes slowly, painfully ticked by I came to accept my punishment.
rotten	What's important is that the novel began life as Twilight fan fiction. That tells you everything you need to know.
rotten	It needed to take the plunge, strengthen the sexual moments, and submit to the book's "mommy porn" reputation. Instead, it played it too safe.
rotten	For a movie that traffics in the promise of sexual adventure, it's founded upon a woefully conservative narrative.
rotten	There's a big problem with "Fifty Shades of Grey," and his name is Jamie Dornan.
fresh	The book has a reputation for being a compendium of ridiculous lines. The film is entertaining because it understands the humour of the material and milks the exchanges with knowing delight.
fresh	"Fifty Shades of Grey" turns out to be an intriguing tussle - not in the sack, or in the Red Room of Pain, but in its internal war between the dubious erotica of James' novel (the first of three) and the far craftier trash offered by the movie.
fresh	I'm not going to pretend I didn't like this movie, just as I can't pretend there's nothing wrong with it. But try thinking of it this way: It's an event movie that's also a relationship drama, and that's rare.
rotten	I expected a lot of things from "Fifty Shades of Grey," but I didn't expect to be bored.
rotten	An unashamed and genially preposterous fairy tale, a kind of "Cinderella" with restraints, "50 Shades" is about as believable as "Jack and the Beanstalk," albeit considerably more kinky in intent.
rotten	Vainly seeking to reach the widest possible audience, the makers of this exercise in banality stripped it of almost anything that could cause offence.
rotten	For a movie where people are naked for a large chunk of time and play at bondage and dominance (without ever really seeming all that committed to it), it sure is boring.
fresh	It may be perfectly sufficient that, above all else, Fifty Shades of Grey captures the shallow essence of its source material.
fresh	These two star-crossed lovers have a lot more to negotiate than just the path to true love.
rotten	Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one a sensual and stylish romance, and the other a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life.
fresh	I can't help but feel that if this was subtitled and in Polish or French or something, then critics would be losing their collective minds over it.
rotten	Colorless
rotten	There's undoubtedly more nudity than in a standard 21st Century Hollywood movie, but it's less explicit and less passionate than what Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone got up to in Basic Instinct more than 20 years ago.
rotten	What's troubling and somewhat dangerous is that underneath the twisted sex, this story contains the same template of every aspirational romance.
rotten	I'm shocked - shocked, do you hear me?!? - that the film version of E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey is such a dull, decorous affair, about as erotic as an ad for Pottery Barn. Strictly intended for gluttons for punishment-by boredom.
fresh	It has an impressive performance from Dakota Johnson (daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, granddaughter of Tippi Hedren.) But it doesn't really feel like a date movie.
rotten	Overall, no-one's going to be needing a cold shower after this. However, half a glass of something beforehand in the company of like-minded friends is definitely recommended.
fresh	There is no denying that Fifty Shades, for the most part, is nonsensical and absurd, but it's undoubtedly good fun.
fresh	The only thing Dakota Johnson can't pull off is her character's over-dramatic name - she introduces herself as Anastasia Steele like an apology.
fresh	[Taylor-Johnson] has very professionally rendered this potent rubbish much less ridiculous, much more of a marketable proposition, than could have been expected.
rotten	Maybe in future installments there will even be something that resembles a plot. For now, the entire movie is about as sexy as a root canal.
rotten	I wouldn't say that Taylor-Johnson has made a good movie from "Fifty Shades of Grey," precisely. That's asking too much.
fresh	Johnson has a great knack with comedy, salting silly lines with witty humor, and giving ridiculous moments just the right roll of the eyes.
rotten	It looks and feels like a sequel to Twilight, with deadly dull talk about S&M replacing endless consternation over turning into one of the undead.
rotten	Think World of Interiors meets The Little Book of Bondage, and you may get the picture, which starts out hilarious, becomes ludicrous and finally dubious.
rotten	Obsessed with money, willfully wrongheaded about sex and crippled by its own construction, Fifty Shades of Grey is too many kinds of awful to work as anything but accidental sociology: We get the smut we deserve.
fresh	It proves that age-old saw that great books rarely make great films, whereas barely-literate junk can turn into something ripe and even electric on screen.
rotten	My God, this thing goes on. By the time the two get busy in Christian's "playroom," the oomph has gone out of the whole erotic setup ...
rotten	The film's intense commitment to being dull makes you long for sparkly vampires and werewolves.
rotten	If this were a parody of romance, the film might be considered valid; but somehow the cast and crew appear to treat the venture as realistic.
rotten	Easily amongst the seven or eight best Hollywood productions ever made about a woman contemplating whether or not to sign a dominant/submissive contract.
rotten	A limp bore.
rotten	The whole thing's about as transgressive as ordering a Cabernet Sauvignon with your fish.
rotten	"Fifty Shades of Grey" might not be a good movie - O.K., it's a terrible movie - but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment.
rotten	To her credit, Taylor-Johnson proves that graphic images are not needed and this is the first mainstream Hollywood film that successfully shows female pleasure in bondage scenes. Unfortunately, we have to wade through an awful lot that is trite.
fresh	Fifty Shades of Grey is an entertaining, witty, and yes occasionally sexy fable of female assertiveness disguised as a tale of submission.
rotten	Maybe the smoulderingly sado-obsessed hero does not have a penis. It could account for his tastes. And his decor.
rotten	Jamie Dornan somehow manages to render his sculpted beauty moot, which throws a major wrench in the gears for a film dependent on eroticism.
fresh	It's no Clint Eastwood's superheroic saving of 'The Bridges of Madison County,' but it'll do.
rotten	We may have all been curious going in, but by the time the credits roll, there's another question that springs to mind: Is that all there is?
rotten	Despite the endless sex, a highly unsatisfying encounter. Cold as a fish and almost as dumb.
fresh	Fifty Shades of Grey is not the lame, hot-and-bothered fantasy romance many, including myself, thought it would be. It's got wit and humor and a modest intelligence about human behavior that, say, the Twilight movies never had.
fresh	The movie Fifty Shades of Grey is considerably better written than the book. It is also sort of classy-looking, in a generic, TV-ad-for-bath-oil way.
rotten	Sitting through the turgid and tedious S&M melodrama that is Fifty Shades of Grey may feel like its own form of torture.
rotten	"Fifty Shades Of Grey" is embarrassing and depressing, especially when considering the picture as a reflection of the quality and state of mainstream modern romance today.
fresh	"The stylish and mostly satisfying film will be [a blockbuster], and deservedly so. Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan, Taylor-Johnson's erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James' first book."
fresh	After the reams of commentary EL James' books have inspired (and recent faith-based protests) this big screen adaptation still manages to be about people, and even a little bit sweet.
rotten	Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porno.
rotten	The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non-existent. Here is a Valentine's Day movie that will certainly make bank, but you aren't helping yourself or anyone else by seeing it.
fresh	Gone are the truly dreadful aspects of the book, and the biggest surprise may be that Ana and Christian have developed senses of humor.
rotten	No amount of polished technical ingredients can salvage a relatively faithful screenplay that lifts much of the book's painfully rudimentary dialogue verbatim.
fresh	Glossy, well cast, and a consistent hoot until it becomes a serious drag.
fresh	Accept this genuinely sexy, somewhat silly, relatively timid romantic drama on its own escapist terms and you'll find sufficient pleasure.
fresh	Fifty Shades of Grey is a sex-positive but hopelessly soft-core erotic drama that fails to be even a fraction as titillating as the E.L. James books that inspired it. And yet, that's exactly why it works.
fresh	Aiming to please, the filmmakers submit without hesitation to the bold yet hokey source material, with leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson breathing a crucial third dimension into cutout characters.
fresh	Johnson is a true find: She's so committed, she makes Ana's every discovery - in or out of the bedroom - convincing.
fresh	Simons is a fascinating central figure, even if the straightforward approach seems determined not to ruffle any feathers.
fresh	J'adore "Dior and I."
rotten	If only "Dior and I" told us why we should care.
fresh	All that effort just to make a dress still seems a bit silly, but the passion and integrity of those involved are hard not to take seriously.
fresh	A piece of Dior haute couture to hang in the closet is probably not in most of our futures, but this enthralling documentary allows viewers to finger the hem, so to speak, of some grand designs indeed.
fresh	Fascinating, suspenseful, illuminating, and ultimately moving.
fresh	From creating photo files rather than sketching dresses, to fitting them on lithe human pipe cleaners who march them across the catwalk, the film is a serious look at a business containing surprising amounts of tension.
fresh	The movie, not to mention the company, deserves praise for showing the challenges as well as the triumphs; "Dior and I" doesn't shy away from conflicts when they arise. This isn't marketing material. It's a real look at a fascinating line of work.
rotten	This undramatic and flat peek "inside" the sewing rooms of Christian Dior holds little in the way of entertainment.
fresh	Perhaps "Dior and I" isn't profound work, but the opportunity to study the creative process in a place of incredible history is rare, making the documentary a must-see for fashion admirers.
fresh	Viewers become so involved in their proficient, collaborative activity that the catwalk spectacle is almost dull in comparison.
fresh	We get to know the people - mostly women, but a few men - whose hands create these intricate, beautiful garments.
fresh	Tcheng finds Simons in moments of haughty self-confidence and tremulous self-doubt.
rotten	A few gauzy montages of black-and-white archival footage glorify the fashion house's founder and namesake, providing a welcome interruption to all the self-serving confessionals and stage-managed conflicts.
rotten	[It] adds up to something that won't have much appeal beyond the fashionista crowd. And even they probably would prefer browsing through one of the designer's catalogs than sitting through this glossy bore.
fresh	The documentary offers a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the workings of a business. It's also about the difficulties of the creative process, the running of an organization, and the adjustments that must be made when a new boss is in town.
fresh	This exceptional [cross cutting] structure allows the past to continue informing the present, reaching a climax after lights out in the ateliers, Tcheng projecting old Dior imagery over the white toiles that are the blueprints of Simons' first collection.
fresh	Much more than a documentary about a fashion house, this film finds real resonance in its central characters
rotten	We get no sense that Simons is invested in the work, or concerned about what's at stake for his personal reputation, or has any insight into what he does with his time to balance what presumably are many other responsibilities and pressures.
fresh	If the ungodly star-driven media frenzy that surrounds the spring collections of the great Paris houses like Christian Dior is the public face of designer fashion, "Dior and I" shows us that what goes on behind the scenes is even more intriguing.
fresh	One does come away with a grudging admiration for the toil and ingenuity of the many players who bring it all together.
fresh	Tcheng manages to excite and move while painting a complete portrait of an artist challenged by his new post's unprecedented legacy.
fresh	The drama of getting new dresses on the runway turns out to be transfixing, while the hero redefines the notion of intense.
fresh	Dior and I expertly observes all aspects of Simons' stressful transition, especially in the minutiae of being both an artist and a manager.
fresh	Though the film is unquestionably a flattering portrait of Simons, it is also more broadly, and more fruitfully, a testament to a tradition and to those who have upheld it for decades.
fresh	"Dior and I" intimately demonstrates the tricky balance between art and commerce, between perpetuating a mythology while attending to the bottom line, and doing it with the pressure of a ticking clock.
fresh	The heart of Dior and I is with these seamstresses and cutters, artists in their own right.
rotten	As shallow as the world it depicts with much-precedented 'unprecedented access.'
rotten	Access to an institution like the house of Dior is a rare and precious thing, and Mr. Tcheng has paid for it with a flattering portrait dressed up to look like cleareyed scrutiny.
fresh	Tcheng gets under Simons' skin - we see the designer's methods of work, insecurities, vulnerabilities and his ability to cut through the noise.
fresh	For all the seductive imagery of billowing apparel and impossibly angled high heels, Tcheng never loses sight of the people overseeing every stitch.
rotten	Diverting but disappointingly hollow fashion film.
fresh	For all its grand statements about artistry and identity, it's most effective as a study of the hard work, both physical and emotional, that goes into creating something new.
fresh	Dior and I is a great fashion movie, but it's also a superb picture about the art of management, applicable to any field.
rotten	Dull and undramatic
fresh	The venerable Parisian couture house Christian Dior gets a makeover in Dior And I, which follows a new design director's rough journey to the runway.
fresh	Frederic Tcheng's fascinating documentary looks at the attempts by the Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons to revitalise Christian Dior with his first haute-couture collection.
fresh	The most interesting element about the documentary Dior and I... is the insight we get into the process and the skilled artists in the atelier that elevates this above the standard fashion hagiography.
fresh	Though nicely made, Dior and I is every bit as escapist as the last Star Trek movie.
fresh	A completely fascinating peek inside a legendary fashion house where the demands of business and art clash in interesting ways.
fresh	Of special interest to a limited audience, this backstage look at fashion design at the house of Christian Dior will tell you what you always wanted to know about the most elite segment of the rag trade.
fresh	It is absurd, but mesmeric.
fresh	Frederic Tcheng's Dior and I is a fashion doc with both a sense of history and a feel for the energy of a work in progress.
fresh	Pleasant but slight.
fresh	As carefully crafted as the clothes is Tcheng's well-considered direction, privileging the creative process over stereotyped glamour or backstabbing (this is no Ready to Wear).
fresh	More compelling when focusing on long-serving staff and their skills and opinions.
fresh	Whether or not you care about fashion, it's an absolute must-see.
fresh	Simons is intriguing, but the warmth and charm of the seamstresses carry the film.
fresh	Fashion fans will love this fly-on-the-wall doc.
fresh	A film that favours a subtle portrait of the demands of the creative process over scandal-sniffing or melodrama.
fresh	Dior and I blends cinema into fashion rather than simply filming the making of expensive clothes.
fresh	...Dior And I succeeds in bringing this exclusive world down to earth, knitting the viewer with its needles and threads and making a highly relatable story, no matter where you come from or how you feel about fashion.
rotten	It proves an increasingly superficial affair, especially given that the director's attempts at suspense are largely facile and Raf Simons's creative process is barely investigated.
fresh	It's a caper movie you can keep up with if you just 'Focus.'
fresh	It's nice to see Will Smith having fun in a role again, and Margot Robbie makes for a good partner in crime.
fresh	Focus is fun, slick, engaging and sexy. Also Margot Robbie.
fresh	The leads are appealing together, and that turns out to be the most crucial element of the movie.
rotten	The hole in the story is Smith, who holds onto his detached Will Smith screen persona too closely to make his portrayal on a con man convincing.
rotten	Focus would like nothing more than to evoke the easy style and playful personality of the Oceans movies, but surface glamour is no substitute for character.
rotten	You don't want to be any of these b*******.
rotten	It's ironic that a movie titled "Focus" never truly provides a focal point for its audience.
fresh	For the start of 2015 this is a strong film that audiences will enjoy!
rotten	If I wanted to see a thief not have a good time, I'd just find footage of Robin Thicke hearing the "Blurred Lines" plagiarism verdict.
fresh	Focus is a movie with an arbitrary title, but full commitment from its cast.
fresh	The film bogs down, certainly, and it bogs down in some very damaging places. But it soars just enough to be, on balance, an enjoyable bit of fluff.
fresh	Surprisingly enjoyable in spite of its flaws, Focus almost 'cons' you into having a good time.
rotten	Fails to ensnare its audience thanks to fatiguingly frequent "ah, bet you didn't see that coming" narrative twists.
fresh	Focus is great fun (if morally bankrupt).
rotten	Focus is not a picture that reflects reality, and requires a true suspension of disbelief to fully get along with. However even then, it's still something of a struggle.
fresh	Will gets into pulling off the somehow simultaneous unusual challenge of getting into the trickster head of his artful dodger character Nicky manipulating the world around him, and impressing the audience with believable master con moves as well.
fresh	Enjoyable, disposable, twist-laden fun, the film does suffer from that weird, ironic movie syndrome wherein it works so hard to be unpredictable that it adopts a predictable pattern.
fresh	In Focus, [Smith is] quieter, graver, more emotionally remote, more... substantial.
rotten	One twist and turn too many. Robbie shines while Smith doesn't.
fresh	It has so much eye-candy razzle-dazzle, and it looks so fabulous, you forget its flaws and get lost in its cool, groovy vibes and its long-con gamesmanship, and-hey, where's my wallet?!!
rotten	Focus has some hard swallows, including a last-reel speech so inessential it's comical, but it's also got a unique syncopation about it that's admirable, if not entirely effective.
fresh	[Writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa] set exactly the right tone as well as tweaking the plot with enough twists to keep your brain engaged. And it looks good too.
fresh	There are a few problems with the film, not least the ending (no spoilers), but it has the pizazz and all the elements that you would expect from a film like this.
rotten	Focus, while being generally entertaining, is a largely familiar and overly glossy run through cinematic con artist conventions
rotten	Never boring but not all that engaging, "Focus" proves that Will Smith still has all the charisma he ever did. Unfortunately, that's not enough to distract us from a mediocre flick.
rotten	Once the real game begins, the humor starts to miss and the plot points get ridiculously unbelievable. While Smith shows flashes of his classic charisma, Robbie is under-used and no one else is around to step up and make us care.
fresh	Focus is fun, slick, engaging and sexy. Also Margot Robbie.
fresh	Focus is about the sensation of having your wallet lifted by a pickpocket with nimble fingers. And it's skilled enough to earn the viewer's emptier billfold.
rotten	The biggest con is its lack of cons.
rotten	That sound you hear is the high-fives in the writers' room, and that, unfortunately, is where the filmmakers' focus remains.
rotten	Can they trust each other? Of course not. Do we care? Not really.
fresh	It's slick and fast and crammed with cons both big and small, but it's the irresistible dynamic between Will Smith and Margot Robbie that makes this smoke and mirrors flick so enjoyable
fresh	This is a fun movie with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. There are some nice set-ups and the story is clever in places, but not quite clever enough. The acting is solid, the pace is fast and the production values are good.
rotten	Based on 2013's Now You See Me and this picture, it's obvious that Hollywood's hustlers have lost their sting since the days of Paul Newman.
fresh	The first half of 'Focus' is close to flawless as it slickly delivers laughs and tense set pieces that more than pay off.
rotten	When a character refers early on to a manoeuvre called the 'Toledo panic button', anyone familiar with Chekhov's loaded rifle just knows it's going to be pushed before the movie's end.
rotten	By the end, it feels as though moviegoers are the ones who need to check their pockets.
rotten	Had this been a stepping-stone project for Smith in the mid-90s, it would have been perfectly fine. However, I expected more from Will Smith.
rotten	...it's finally impossible not to wonder if the film might've fared better had it not contained such a ludicrous romantic pairing.
fresh	Though it may not go the way you expect it to, Focus makes up for that small disappointment ... with a denouement that's refreshingly uncynical.
rotten	A load of con-artist movie hooey with two spectacular looking leads.
fresh	Focus is a movie about con artists that itself is a complete con. It swivels logic and loyalties when necessary, borrows from better cinema scams like The Sting, and plays everyone for suckers. Focus is also a decent amount of fun.
fresh	A smart, often wickedly funny look at two people trying to be true to themselves while being utterly false to everyone else.
fresh	Despite its 'never lose focus' catchphrase, unnecessary tangents and underwhelming reveals make Focus a somewhat unfocused, though still enjoyable, viewing experience.
fresh	[For Smith,] Focus isn't a full return to brilliance but a welcome stop, hopefully, on the way there.
fresh	With Smith back in his element plus the timeless appeal of a well-executed con story, Focus is undeniably fun.
rotten	Robbie brings such genuine feeling to heavier scenes and such joy to light ones that her acting fools us into thinking Jess is a more developed character than she is.
fresh	Ficarra and Requa direct some fascinating sequences, including a long, brisk montage of illegal acts that shows us how Nicky's team operates.
rotten	Making matters somehow worse, co-directors Ficarra and Requa give the proceedings the high gloss of a luxury-car commercial in an effort to offset the film's toxic levels of avarice with some visual glamour.
fresh	It's a shiny, diverting ride. (And right about now, that's OK.)
fresh	Perhaps the film's greatest trick is the one that happens offscreen: Hours after the end credits roll, it will completely disappear from your mind.
rotten	While Focus is fun, with intrigue, twists, and turns that will likely only hold up to one viewing, the romance ends up being the focus. Unfortunately, loyalty between liars doesn't equal a love story.
rotten	This is the kind of movie where we're not supposed to know at any time who is playing whom, but since the characterizations are glossy and paper-thin, it's difficult to get worked up about who gets fleeced.
rotten	Engages in so much rug-pulling, eventually, we just stop standing on the rug.
fresh	"Focus" has a flippant air to it, as if defying you to take it seriously.
fresh	Light-hearted and fleet-footed.
fresh	If we're to look at Focus for the qualities of its con, it'll earn your wallet, and you'll be totally okay with that.
rotten	Mildly entertaining, but mostly preposterous.
rotten	...not a scintilla of chemistry between Smith and Robbie...nauseatingly awful love scenes...preposterous situations...dialogue neither clever nor funny...deficient acting (but what could anybody do with this script?)...an ending that is worse than absurd.
fresh	Charming but uneven heist film is too sexy for young teens.
fresh	Two movies for the price of one. You get a sparkling, sexy comedy and its lackluster, dispiriting sequel, both in the same sitting.
rotten	Focus isn't one con too many. It's about a half dozen more than any story can handle.
rotten	It's tough to take anything "Focus" offers seriously when it feels as though Nicky and Jess could pull out lightsabers at any moment.
rotten	Lots of hocus pocus but not much focus in Focus. Or, dare we say Focus is often out of focus? Either works. The movie does not.
fresh	Slick, subversive and distracted, this crime caper is a mildly entertaining diversion.
fresh	As they did in I Love You Phillip Morris and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Ficarra and Requa prove to be masters of misdirection in this fluffy but fun romp.
fresh	Sure, the closer you get the more it has a cubic-zirconia feel, costume jewelry instead of the real thing, but, hey, it's a plenty breezy diversion here in the latter days of this seemingly unending winter.
rotten	A double-cross comedy that doesn't quite work.
fresh	The beautiful people are the sleight of hand that will keep you entertained.
fresh	"Focus" is like the beginner con artist that Margot Robbie plays in the film - not nearly as smart as it thinks it is, but smart enough to steal the price of a ticket from your pocket without you minding too much.
rotten	Someone decided to put a heaping helping of romantic comedy in my heist movie, and it does not taste good.
fresh	Getting the short con right is the charm of "Focus," and the goodwill generated by the setup carries the film even when the long con is, should I say, a bit too manipulated and contrived.
fresh	The mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old Hitchcock.
rotten	It all adds up to an entertaining first half hour or so before the plot begins in earnest and the fun factor starts to droop.
rotten	Drunk on its perfume-ad cinematography and doesn't know when to quit with its double-double cross plotting.
fresh	Smith's natural charisma has been dulled by special effects bonanzas and/or a desire to play against type. In "Focus," he feels like himself again, and he reminds you why he became one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the first place.
rotten	It's not that the movie keeps you guessing with its intricacy, it's more like it's making it up as it goes along.
fresh	Mostly, it is fun to watch Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and to marvel at whatever divine or evolutionary miracle concentrated so much charisma in the two of them.
fresh	It does enough things right to earn a recommendation, but there are misfires aplenty for those who care to look for them.
rotten	Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film - from cowriters/co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa - ultimately makes no sense.
rotten	What 'Focus' lacks most is - focus.
fresh	Smith and Robbie are terrific together. At various points along the way, he's playing her, and then she's playing him, and then we're almost positive they've let their collective guard down and they're really in love ... Or are they?
rotten	Ficarra and Requa repeatedly trying to fool the audience becomes like watching a magician do minor variations of the same trick expecting the audience to remain impressed.
fresh	The problem is the tone. It's uneven with the dead spots designed more to show off Smith's personal magnetism, and how good Robbie and her pulsating lips look in a red evening gown or a black bikini, than it is to further the action.
fresh	With a few extra passes through the scriptwriting phase, this could have been a classic for the genre. As it stands, it has its moments, but the best come early. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Smith Slick, Robbie Sharp in "Focus."
rotten	More entertaining than it deserves to be, "Focus" is still a middle-of-the-pack con man movie - pretty to look at, but too flashy for its own good.
fresh	Although it's the sort of film that can't pass a mirror without pointing a finger and winking at itself, it generally earns the right to do so.
fresh	Yes, it's a trifle of a film, but it's a super fun one, like a magic trick that you know how it plays out but enjoy the show anyway
fresh	Smith is again playing a hustler and shows his familiar charm and charisma. The film itself plays like an ersatz version of one of David Mamet's dramas in which everybody is cheating everybody else, but it suffers from a lack of plausibility.
fresh	The clue to unravelling this entertaining tale of glamorous grifters is in the title.
fresh	This stuff is pretty entertaining on its own, so much that if you just sit back and take it in, you may overlook the fact that the plot is full of holes.
rotten	Like many a grifter, this crime caper is all style and no substance.
fresh	Smith's smooth approach -- coupled with the smoldering stylings of Robbie -- gives "Focus" an odd combination of coolness and heat.
fresh	It's an old-fashioned formula, but it still works well enough.
fresh	The Hollywood stakes for Smith are as high as they are for the con man he plays. As it stands, "Focus" just might be a game changer.
rotten	The problem with Focus is that it never really does - and in its fuzzy-edged attempts to pull off the long con, the film ends up picking its own pocket.
fresh	The film's chief pleasure comes from fighting the desire to believe at any given point that the hero is finally being sincere, that now we are seeing the real man and his real plan.
rotten	In the end, we get the sense that Focus is rigged against us.
rotten	The second half feels like Ficarra and Requa ran out of ideas and just hit restart.
rotten	It passes in a blur of dullness.
rotten	A series of contrived twists...that fails to recapture the magic of the best Hollywood caper movies of the past.
rotten	Tocks like a cheap carriage clock that's been run over almost as often as it's been flung down the stairs.
rotten	We can't say we weren't warned. Will Smith has been telling us not to trust him the entire movie.
rotten	At times ... Focus resembles a commercial for a pricey brand of liquor, an elite hotel or a luxury car more than a story-driven movie.
rotten	Like a counterfeit handbag: It looks great but falls apart when you reach into it.
fresh	...all you'll remember is that you had a good time, and for the filmmakers, that was likely the humble bar they wanted to hit in the first place.
fresh	The story is ludicrous...Yet Focus, Will Smith's mea culpa to moviegoers after the post-apocalyptic tedium of After Earth two years ago, is more breezily enjoyable than it has a right to be.
fresh	Writer/director Glenn Ficarra & John Requa's ("Crazy, Stupid, Love") latest is a little bit "Now You See Me," a little bit "Out of Sight"...a nice bounce back for Will Smith.
fresh	a late winter season surprise.
rotten	You come out feeling you've been had by well-intentioned crooks who aren't ready for the big show.
rotten	The film itself comes to feel like a con, thanks to a script that's too clever by two-thirds, and butterfingered in the ways of portraying love.
fresh	FOCUS is pleasant and fizzy, but slightly too soft.
fresh	Decent but unremarkable ... the kind of movie you see with some pleasure but no dreams of sequels or remakes.
fresh	There's much to be said for a film that doesn't overreach, delivers on most of its promises and gets the audience out the door in just over an hour and a half.
fresh	The two stars are dazzling distractions. Robbie is a wow and then some. The Aussie actress shows a comic flair backed up with beauty and steel. Even when Focus fumbles, Robbie deals a winning hand.
fresh	Smith and Robbie have fantastic chemistry, and they both bring natural charm to their wary but exuberant characters.
rotten	Focus turns out to be a strained trumpeting of the return of the proverbial king of the box office.
rotten	[Will] Smith isn't at his best here. The role of Nicky tamps down his strengths as a star, forcing him to rein in his outsized persona.
fresh	You don't have to check your brain at the door, exactly, but you might want to set it to cruise control.
fresh	There's a ton of good stuff in "Focus," but it's frequently undercut by twist after twist after twist, which sort of make us question why we're supposed to care in the first place.
fresh	This is maximum-gloss entertainment with its fair share of tricksy rug-pulls. But, like one of the neon-coloured cocktails Smith drinks in it, it's more of an immediate rush than something you'll remember in a year.
rotten	Flash trash.
rotten	I really love what "Focus" is trying to do, which makes it an even bigger bummer that it doesn't succeed.
rotten	It's yet another reminder that if it's not called "The Sting," you shouldn't get too comfortable with a con-game movie.
fresh	It's like a thief you see from a mile away, who telegraphs his or her every move, and still steals your wallet.
rotten	Smith and Robbie, both going through the motions, don't click at all, and Robbie in particular has nothing to play.
rotten	A slick, derivative con man movie starring a typically debonair Will Smith.
fresh	Smith wears it like a well-tailored suit, and the brisk, snappy dialogue is well delivered by an able cast.
rotten	It doesn't take long to catch on to the modus operandi of the romantic comedy/drama Focus -- no matter what outrageous things happen, they will invariably be revealed as elaborate con jobs designed to hoodwink suckers, just like us.
rotten	Focus is basically two movies stitched together by the same connective tissue, and only one of the halves is any good.
rotten	Even in a lark about con artists working through their trust issues, we need more.
rotten	"Focus" is ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth, that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.
fresh	It's beautifully photographed and entertaining, with charming performances by Will Smith and newcomer Margot Robbie that tease and tantalize. You won't be bored.
fresh	Although it brings nothing new to the con-artist fold, or even anything thrilling, "Focus" is a seductive enough rehash that benefits from the built-in pleasures of the trade.
fresh	Focus is a shiny, stylish shell game of a film that, much like its protagonists, relies on breezy chatter, a good sense of humor and a lot of misdirection to succeed.
fresh	A very odd blend of caper action, dark drama and romantic comedy, this slickly made con-artist romp never quite finds its stride...
rotten	Unpleasant, humor free, and contrary to accepted codes of movie morality. And that's before it shows its hand as a pile of implausible sentimental mush.
rotten	If it was a real con artist, it would be led away in handcuffs. Nice try, almost got away with it, but not quite.
fresh	The aces up Focus' sleeve are gorgeous stars Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who are so distractingly good they could pick our pockets blind.
fresh	Co-stars Will Smith and Margot Robbie remain consistently charismatic, even once the script for this heist caper collapses in a punishing pile of its own twists and double-crosses.
fresh	Works hard and does manage to generate entertainment. But the strain shows.
fresh	20 times hotter, 200 times smarter than Fifty Shades of Grey.
fresh	Sexy stars, pretty cities, nice music and some tricky action. If that's a con game, well - I'm happy to be had. And you will be, too.
rotten	Focus' problem isn't that its stars lack charm, but that it's squeezed into tight spaces between protracted explanations of setups, backstories, and twists-a poor example of the every-shot-must-convey-narrative-information school of filmmaking.
rotten	In this lame caper, the biggest scam perpetrated is the one that makes audiences think they'll have a good time.
fresh	Inconsequential but stimulatingly grown-up, "Focus" rides a wave of cool to the finish.
fresh	If Grace Kelly had been raised by coyotes, she might have stalked the screen like Focus' Margot Robbie, a va-va-voom blonde with bite
fresh	I wonder how huge the disparity between the pay of the two stars was.
fresh	What keeps the film humming along as smoothly as it does is the chemistry and charisma of its leads.
fresh	Will Smith and Margot Robbie generate enough chemistry to steam up the screen and make the farfetched romantic romp just worth the watch, provided eye candy alone can do for you in lieu of credulity.
fresh	As an audience, we should be having the same kind of fun that we had in the third act of The Sting. Why aren't we?
rotten	A predictably unpredictable tale of conmen and women complete with the industry-mandated quantity of fast cars, short skirts, sharp suits, slippery billionaires and "Oh, it was that guy all along!" plot twists.
fresh	Focus may have solved the conundrum of the con artist movie. Writer/directors Glenn Ficara and John Requa pulled off the ultimate prestige.
fresh	The hotels and high-end clubs in Focus are extraordinarily furnished, and Smith and Robbie look splendid gallivanting among them.
fresh	There's enough to be entertained by in Focus that even when it teeters into ridiculous over-plotting, you know that you can bet on Ficarra and Requa to put together another great centerpiece scene.
fresh	A nice mix of old school romance with an inside look at the world of con men and pick pockets, which ultimately does make for an entertainment film.
rotten	Let's just say Travolta and Idina Menzel had more chemistry, and leave it at that.
fresh	Will Smith is at the top of his game in Focus, finally back in a movie that deserves him. It's an exciting, funny and sensual film.
fresh	Like a perfect cocktail mixes the sour with the sweet and the bright with the boozy, "Focus" combines seamless, superbly-crafted filmmaking with the fizz and fun created by its leads.
rotten	One of those empty, know-it-all tales about grifters working scams, and each other, wrapped around an equally vapid love story.
rotten	This kind of film needs a punchy right hook to follow up its clever, if outlandish, jab late in the game, and "Focus" doesn't deliver.
fresh	It's not as smart as you want it to be, but it's a lot smarter than the worst examples of the genre.
rotten	Swindler cinema is only as good as its architecture; once the big picture is revealed, viewers should be thrilled at having had one pulled over on them. Focus, sadly, leaves you feeling bilked.
rotten	Let's hope this slips away before everyone realizes that terrific hot chick from The Wolf of Wall Street stars in this. Will Smith goes through it looking angry at his agent.
rotten	Unfortunately, since the major characters' salient character traits are insincerity, opaqueness and untruthfulness, it's hard to invest much interest in any of them.
fresh	While not quite the "art" it's billed to be, if the perfect con is about diverting one's focus, then this one keeps you distracted till the end.
rotten	A stylish, consistently diverting romantic caper that, nonetheless, leaves you feeling that you've been jerked around without sufficient payoff.
fresh	If you can believe that two guys would each carry $1.2 million cash to the racetrack, you can accept anything this picture throws at you.
fresh	There's not a ton to Focus beneath its surface pleasures, but its surfaces are pleasurable as hell.
fresh	Focus is a pretty terrific little movie.
rotten	Few films are more annoying than a con caper that has nothing up its sleeve except cool, designer style and Focus falls squarely into that category.
fresh	There's a slinky, Soderbergh vibe in the DNA here; Focus feels like it's pitched somewhere between Out Of Sight and Ocean's Eleven.
fresh	Focus, nicely filmed and very competent, delivers come snappy dialogue and fizzy, forgettable fun.
rotten	The premise is preposterous and the plot has more holes than St Andrews.
rotten	Don't get me wrong, Focus definitely has its moments, but it's far from essential viewing.
rotten	Aggressively dull and terribly paced.
rotten	I hope this noble failure doesn't see the Wachowskis deprived of future funding, because ambitious failure is at least worth talking about.
rotten	I kind of had a tepidly good time in "Jupiter Ascending." It won me over in the same way that bag of tater tots in the freezer wins you over: it has its own freezer-burned charm.
rotten	It lacks the special-effects advancements, entertaining performances, and existential cool that made [the Wachowskis'] breakthrough success such a milestone.
rotten	An utterly gorgeous visual delight, and it has some enjoyably goofy moments, managing to throw in some left-leaning, anti-elitism socio-economic subtext for good measure.
rotten	It's the kind of stuff that one can imagine working on the page in 1950, but its visual incarnation via CGI and elaborate production design results in overload
fresh	You'd have to be craving something highly specific and more than a little freaky to be in the mood for Jupiter Ascending, the latest multi-million-dollar weird-fest from the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana.
fresh	It's so intricately designed, so expensive looking and so obviously inaccessible to general audiences that its very existence is a miracle.
fresh	The Wachowski siblings' sprawling, mega-sized, enjoyably loopy space lark.
fresh	Fast, frequently teetering on the cusp of the ridiculous, and eye-poppingly pretty, Jupiter Ascending is a wicked slice of entertainment, and a heck of an antidote to the typical February box-office blahs.
rotten	With just a few script tweaks, this long, dull and downright bizarre bore-a-thon could have been more aptly named Uranus Numbing.
fresh	Openly loves the corny nonsense it's referencing and wants to bring it to breathtakingly gorgeous life with all of the money the Wachowskis could spirit away.
fresh	Obsession with reincarnation, blurry gender lines, alternate realities, and new modes of action are just some of the reasons that its diversions are where its at. They're baked into the movie's DNA, even as the screenplay tries to follow familiar tropes.
rotten	Where were the Guardians of the Galaxy when we needed them? If only they had prevented the disastrous atrocity that is "Jupiter Ascending" from infiltrating Earth's movie theaters before it was too late!
fresh	Jupiter Ascending leaves so numb that you'll have pins and needles.
fresh	You get an awful lot of movie for your sixteen - or whatever - bucks with The Wachowski's Jupiter Ascending, a crazy, fun, infuriating, difficult, fun, bonkers, expensive, fun, ludicrous, romantic, fun flick.
rotten	The film is deeply cynical about its special effects, which are employed to deter us from the poor script and performances.
fresh	I still don't know what Jupiter Ascending is about but, wow, what a ride.
rotten	It is the shaggiest of the Wachoski's shaggy dogs.
rotten	Basically, it's Cinderella, complete with sparkly dresses and a magical sky person telling poor Cinders she is actually very special. Truly awful.
rotten	Baffling... (but) a cult classic in waiting.
rotten	While the visuals dazzle, the storyline never grabs hold.
rotten	Never predictable in when it will stun the senses or bore you into submission.
fresh	You can literally feel the sloppy, all-encompassing and not always rational love that its creators have for the material, and their desire to offer up something new is deeply engaging.
fresh	The scale and visuals of this high concept sci-fi spectacle are as extraordinary as the plot is confusing, but you have to hand it to the Wachowskis, in their creation of Jupiter Ascending, there is no shortage of imagination
rotten	Like a gonzo, gazillion-dollar mash-up of 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' steered by a committee of 13-year-old boys hyped on an all-weekend 'Star Wars'/'Star Trek' marathon and fueled by Mountain Dew and Pixy Sticks.
rotten	Part Cinderella wish-fulfillment fairy tale and part corporate-culture critique: Humankind is simply 'a resource waiting to be converted into capital,' sneers villainous Eddie Redmayne.
rotten	A muddled fantasy pours on the visual stimulation
rotten	It's as if the Wachowskis saw what Thor got away with (silly aliens, dynastic rivalries, re-writing the history of earth, elaborate mythologies, and enough Freud to confuse you for a lifetime) and said, "Hey, we want to do that."
rotten	Alas, it's a bit too earthbound.
rotten	A Wachowski film now, more and more, belongs to that subset of sci-fi embarrassments that go for broke and mistake speculative fiction for costume pageants.
fresh	Since this is a Wachowski offering, the visuals are frequently stunning in an overwhelming manner, and scene after scene is quite entertaining. There is a problem, though, with the casting.
rotten	We've all been waiting around for them to give us another Matrix, but as the last 15 years-15 years!-have ground on, it has becoming increasingly clear that they learned the wrong lesson from that movie's success.
fresh	The movie features so many royal machinations, it could be the pilot for an SF rival to "Game of Thrones." Along with all that plot, the Wachowskis offer exactly one idea.
fresh	It's big. It's goofy. It's highly imaginative. It has a little something on its mind. And it's fun. In other words, it's a film from the Wachowskis.
rotten	To the extent we still demand rich characters and sensible plotting, the Wachowskis' latest is a few planets short of a galaxy.
rotten	The Wachowskis have seldom disappointed but frequently bewildered with their varied choices and willingness to experiment within the Hollywood big budget formula, which makes Jupiter their strangest concoction yet - a purely conventional one.
rotten	A lot of people spent a lot of time and a lot of money making a lot of movie, but there's not much there.
rotten	Stunning images, silly story.
fresh	The movie as a whole has a generic, lazy quality to it. Which is shocking, considering the source. Even Cloud Atlas was far more ambitious than this.
rotten	This joyless, twisted tale of royal interstellar intrigue looks gorgeous on the screen, but the story stalls out and falls flat. The story gets tangled up in convoluted plot twists and half-revealed schemes that choke the life out of it.
rotten	A film that begins with the line, "tonight the sky is full of miracles" is downhill from there.
rotten	The Wachowskis create a churning, swooping C.G.I. universe that's decorated to the corners of the frame without taste or imagination.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending vibrates like an episode of Star Wars retold by a teenager on Red Bull, a cacophony of nonsense that peaks with poor Sean Bean telling us that "bees are genetically designed to recognise royalty".
rotten	One wild, wacky mess of a movie.
rotten	Everything about this movie is overcooked. The sets are overdesigned, the action is over scored and the mythology overworked.
fresh	When it comes to bonkers, overcooked, overambitious sci-fi, writer/directors Andy and Lana Wachowski really are in a world of their own.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending can be visually engaging at times, but its storyline is tiresome and its special effects are more cluttered than Transformers. Its more of a motivational video for janitors than a satisfying piece of entertainment.
fresh	Jupiter Ascending is a fascinating and beautiful movie that might have a problem connecting with the average filmgoer, and that's a shame.
rotten	A girl from the "projects" would rather stay put than be the hereditary Queen of a bunch of planets including Earth. Reincarnation gets a slap in the face. The reconstituted Queen hates her kids.
rotten	You have to hand it to the Wachowskis, even when they don't quite pull it off, they fail in new and interesting ways.
rotten	A cosmic misfire: spectacular to look at but spectacularly silly... Mila Kunis goes from scrubbing toilets in Chicago to being hailed queen of the universe but the movie goes right down the pan.
rotten	There's actually a seed of a good idea buried in Jupiter Ascending ... But the entire project suffers from a severe case of overkill, with the Wachowskis offering too much arid exposition and too many artless explosions.
rotten	Inanely scripted and flamboyantly directed, it's a preposterous cinematic disaster - with vivid, eye-popping visual effects more suited to video games.
rotten	It's a high-minded exercise in spectacle over substance that winds up getting lost in space.
rotten	Don't even get me started on the aliens, many of whom would have been turned away from the cantina door in Mos Eisley.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending is a baffling mix of material that is both impressively innovative, and utterly ridiculous.
fresh	Jupiter Ascending... is a visually stunning space opera that will remind you of Guardians of the Galaxy set in a sci-fi version of the Game of Thrones universe... [or] sort of Maleficent and Star Wars combined in superhero genre form.
rotten	Redmayne's farcical grandiosity harkens back to science-fiction serials of the 1930s, but unfortunately so does Jupiter's passivity throughout the film.
rotten	For all the elaborate backstory, nothing feels particularly original, and the Wachowskis struggle to find a coherent tone, with the jokey segments mostly falling flat.
fresh	Tatum, Kunis, Redmayne and the rest of the space kids gang are pawns on a chess board. Thankfully, Bobby Fischer is moving the pieces.
rotten	Two years from now, when you're home with the flu and it pops up on cable, you may well kill two hours watching it. That's really the only circumstance under which this ridiculous mess is likely to be acceptable.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending is inane from first frame to last - the dialogue is so clunky, I wondered if George Lucas had been brought in to do the rewrite.
rotten	There are rat-faced or bat-winged minions for cosplay geeks, and Tatum shirtless much longer than necessary for Magic Mike fans. Jupiter Ascending has something for everyone and nobody at the same time. Could be worse. Could be Cloud Atlas.
fresh	Upon exiting, my wearied delight with Jupiter Ascending coexisted with pure bafflement. But I exited knowing that I'd seen a movie no other filmmaker could have made.
rotten	This sci-fi-inflected fantasy has many a wince-worthy romantic exchange between stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis.
fresh	This movie often plays like a super-expensive, 21st-century version of one of those "Star Wars" knockoffs made around 1980 by people who weren't George Lucas.
rotten	This self-indulgent, stupid and most unsatisfying feature will quickly descend into the realm of historic cinematic turkeys.
rotten	The only reason to see this movie is to watch the 3-D and the special effects but, good as they are, they are certainly not worth 127 minutes trapped in a theater with Channing Tatum and this story.
rotten	Is there now enough evidence to support the idea that [The Matrix's] pop brilliance, its kinetic-yet-smartly-allegorical storytelling, was an anomaly?
rotten	Jupiter Ascending suffers from stupid. And deja vu. And a lack of discipline. And filmmakers who either can't make another good film -- let alone a great one -- or don't care to.
rotten	There's an escapist summertime space opera buried here somewhere, but Jupiter Ascending's surface is not nearly entertaining enough to encourage us to look for it.
rotten	The script is fraught with cheesy lines and more than a few embarrassingly stupid moments.
rotten	"Jupiter Ascending" is a planet-sized dud.
rotten	The film gets sabotaged by overly long battle scenes, and an unconvincing love story.
rotten	A wonderful screensaver of a movie.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending's early cleverness dries up quickly, especially when Kunis is offscreen, leaving us with just another incoherent sci-fi spectacle.
rotten	It might become a midnight cult favorite a few years down the road, when its inherent awfulness reaches it's-so-bad-it's-good status.
rotten	Perilously close to being "The Space Princess Diaries."
rotten	This kind of pandering FX padding, unnurtured by humor or heart, is what shifts Jupiter Ascending from a shambles to a fiasco. The Wachowskis wind up where you never expected to find them creatively: on the ropes.
rotten	Likely to go down as one of Hollywood's costliest and biggest messes. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	In spite of Andy and Lana Wachowski employing enough effects and CGI artists to populate a mid-sized city, Jupiter Ascending does more descending than ascending.
rotten	Dear Diary, Channing Tatum is soooo cute. I wish he'd play a werewolf and fight vampires and wear eyeliner and no shirt.
fresh	Filmmaking siblings Lana and Andy Wachowski never do anything by halves. The Matrix was a genre-changing blockbuster followed by two head-scratching sequels that ramped everything up a bit too much.
rotten	It feels like the Wachowskis got bored halfway through their world building and thought they could distract viewers by having Channing Tatum take off his shirt, shoot things and fly around on magic boots for two thirds of the movie.
rotten	Tatum looks ready for Star Trek night at Magic Mike's
rotten	Jupiter Ascending sure looks nice, but beyond that it's an incomprehensible mess of a story and certainly the last big-budget gasp for the Wachowskis.
rotten	Exhaustingly awful...
rotten	Warner Bros. has this critic's approval to use my quote in Jupiter Ascending's ad campaign: 'It's not as gloriously awful as feared.'
rotten	Why do people keep giving The Wachowskis money to make movies?!?!?!?
rotten	Call it an epic, or an opus, even an opera, just don't call it good science fiction. ...a schlocky movie that has more in common with THE ICE PIRATES than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.
rotten	The only things likely to ascend during the Wachowskis' latest sci-fi soap opera will be your eyes, which may actually swivel in exasperation up and over, allowing you to see your own brain.
fresh	This film doesn't live up to its potential to be this year's great big stupid movie joke because, well, it's all rather enjoyable. Intentionally enjoyable.
rotten	A beautiful muddle from The Matrix-making Wachowski siblings.
rotten	A big, woozy, spacey fairy tale with a science-fiction exoskeleton and a core of pure mush.
rotten	You can feel the Wachowskis trying to inject a sense of humor into "Jupiter Ascending." But too often the laughs derive from unintentional self-parody related to the grandiose over-reach of the Wachowskis' "world-building."
rotten	"Technically, I'm an alien," Mila Kunis voice-overs, by way of introduction to this epically kitschy space opera ...
fresh	It's a drive-in B-movie delight dressed up in full-blown feature finery.
rotten	Make no mistake: Jupiter Ascending is superficially big and goofy and ostentatious. The movie seems too afraid to truly express those qualities, though.
rotten	only thing that could make Magic Mike more desirable to women is to turn him into a dog with eagle wings.
rotten	A beautiful mess better suited for the silent film era where annoyances like plot and a comprehensive script wouldn't be nearly as problematic.
rotten	"Royal bowels" aren't the only thing that stinks in this terrible sci-fi film.
fresh	Often downright silly, even snicker-worthy. It is over the quota for just-in-time saves...And yet, it is fun and there are even a few moments that are shrewdly conceived.
fresh	It's bold, silly, and messy, but it's sincere... You get the feeling the Wachowskis don't care if it makes money, that they'll happily spin their adventure yarns for whoever will listen.
fresh	A grab-bag of things Wachowski, Jupiter Ascending is short of anything new. On its own terms, it's an entertaining action film that doesn't overstay its welcome. But it's less than we expected.
rotten	The universe that the writers-directors have created is so numbingly complex that keeping track of what is going on can cause headaches.
rotten	This unwieldy space opera is huge in scale and spectacle but thin on story.
rotten	A movie so jaw-droppingly awful that you can't wait to see what happens next (and that was without the use of mood-altering substances on my part).
rotten	While the Wachowskis have not lost their visual flair, the disorganised plot loses your interest very early on.
rotten	It would take quite a movie to emerge unscathed from a script which includes the line "bees are genetically engineered to recognise royalty".
rotten	A melodramatic space opera that wears its social commentary on its celluloid sleeve.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending unfolds as a mostly entertaining mess, a cosmic soup of baroque grandeur that the Wachowskis swim happily through, even if few others will.
rotten	I enjoyed this movie more than the last two films from the Wachowskis, the interminable Cloud Atlas and Speed Racer. On the other hand, "The Matrix" it's not.
rotten	[Jupiter Ascending combines] eye-popping special effects with an eye-rolling script for an experience that is, thankfully, unique.
rotten	Watching Jupiter Ascending is like reading a menu of genre munchies at a drive-thru "B" movie burger stand.
rotten	The credits for "Jupiter Ascending" acknowledge nearly 1,600 artists, technicians, visual imagineers, and pixel-pushers who have labored mightily to bring this story to life. Their efforts only reveal the underlying conceptual hollowness.
rotten	A theatrical feature that, in a rational universe, would never have been put in production, let alone seen the light of day.
rotten	It's not bad in that fascinating, Wachowskian way-it's bad in the same way as most bad sci-fi.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending routinely seems flummoxed by its own mythology and characters.
rotten	For the sake of Neo, Morpheus, the red pill, [and] the blue pill... it would be great to report that the Wachowskis indeed got their groove back. But the only groove they're going to see is the one on multiplex floors as moviegoers stampede the exits.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending comes from a wholehearted and yet misguided place of affection.
fresh	a camp cult classic in the making
rotten	A swollen, strangulated film, a mad mishmash of the past 40 years in science fiction that has a half-wolf soldier played by Channing Tatum find and guard Mila Kunis' maid-turned-galactic-monarch Jupiter Jones.
rotten	Just to get everything in, "Jupiter Ascending" frequently has to stop dead for a character to explain something to us that is both complicated and boring.
fresh	Few will be sorry to have seen "Jupiter Ascending." The Wachowskis have devised a compelling universe, and if they want to continue exploring it for a sequel or two, well, for once that's probably a good idea.
rotten	There's simply not enough time to give any of these stories their due, so instead, each one feels abbreviated. Sometimes, during conspicuous editing, you can almost see where more movie was supposed to exist, like a narrative with phantom limbs.
rotten	Instead of a cinematic drag queen like the guilty pleasure "The Fifth Element," "Jupiter Ascending" is a mutant that's mostly dog.
rotten	Sees no need to engage metaphor or dispense with cliche, so when you haven't seen it before, you can't believe what you're seeing. And not in a good way.
rotten	Talk about lost in space.
fresh	Provides such a tilted spin on a familiar genre that it's easy to pardon some of the labored excesses.
rotten	A pretty but empty sci-fi bauble that quickly sinks in its derivative foolishness.
rotten	The Wachowskis have officially begun cannibalizing their own work.
fresh	It feels vitally fresh and exciting. An overload of ideas, energy, ambition and dopey sincerity is always better than a paucity of the same.
rotten	The story is laughably inane and uninvolving.
fresh	The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious.
rotten	Stay away, stay away.
rotten	At this point, praising the Wachowski siblings as "creators of The Matrix" is like pointing to the boozy, pot-bellied ex-quarterback at a 15th reunion and saying, "Remember that great touchdown pass he threw our senior year?"
rotten	After half an hour, these magnificent images, each one absolutely worth airbrushing on the side of your creepy van, inspire only droopy eyelids.
rotten	For a story that's made up almost entirely of hogwash, Jupiter Ascending never feels as fun as it should.
rotten	Weirdness, exposition, weirdness, exposition, and almost none of it makes a lick of sense. I know I wasn't supposed to laughing at Redmayne but oh, I was.
fresh	If you still have a sense of wonder with which a popcorn movie like Jupiter Ascending can connect, you'll have a good time.
rotten	Like many fantasy features by the Wachowskis, this is a wonder to behold, full of minutely realized gadgetry, but a chore to follow, full of barely realized characters.
rotten	Channing's vulpine hero pales in comparison to a certain Tatooine farm boy, and even though Jupiter Jones ends up looking strikingly Queen Amidala-ish, this isn't even on par with the universally loathed The Phantom Menace.
rotten	For all its valiant attempts to pump some Matrix magic back into science-fiction films, the Wachowskis' ambitious interplanetary thriller Jupiter Ascending amounts to a lot of recycled hot gas.
rotten	May be the Wachowskis' hottest and messiest hot mess yet. It's as ambitious as it is absurd. Well, no ... it's definitely more absurd.
rotten	It's taken 15 years, but the bloated and pitiful Battlefield Earth no longer has to carry the mantle of being the worst big budget science-fiction film of all time.
fresh	The plot thickens. The cosmos explodes. The film is gaga and occasionally glorious. Don't take anyone sensitive to sensory overload.
rotten	Lacks the heart and soul, and especially the visual ingenuity the Wachowskis usually bring to their work.
rotten	The worst movie the Wachowskis have ever made.
fresh	As bad a movie as it is, it's also a singular event, a monument to strange and bizarre decisions stacked one on top of another. Jupiter Ascending is the Winchester Mystery House of movies.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending is only slightly less absurd than Moon Quake Lake, the fake movie within the recent remake of Annie. The difference is that Moon Quake Lake was trying to be ridiculous.
rotten	Both bland and bombastic, Jupiter Ascending shows just how far the Wachowskis are descending as storytellers.
rotten	Not even Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis are enough to save the Wachowskis' gnarly, garish space opera.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending has nothing under its inane surface apart from a vague portentousness untethered to any real stakes.
rotten	If you figure it out, let me know.
rotten	The Wachowskis trade their "Matrix" magic for the silliest space opera since "Flash Gordon."
rotten	Jupiter Ascending is a very special kind of dumb.
rotten	"Jupiter Ascending" promises a galactic ride full of original, thought-provoking science-fiction, but the problem is that The Wachowskis never manage to get their film into orbit.
rotten	A black hole where fun goes to die.
fresh	It's insufficiently silly if anything, and as it wears on it starts to make a kind of sense and even cook. The long stretch where it was barely watchable becomes a distant memory.
fresh	What's sort of remarkable is the way the Wachowskis manage to digest all of their high- and low-brow influences into something like a cohesive worldview.
rotten	This movie is worse than bad. Let's try "epically awful" on for size. "Insanely bloated"; that works. Me, I'll settle for "just plain silly."
rotten	A disaster, a spectacular collapse that can be laid at the feet of the Wachowskis, the brother-and-sister team that took a big-budget challenge from Warner Bros. to deliver an original space opera and spent all the money on set design.
rotten	A stunning, wildly creative book cover with a mediocre story inside.
rotten	From the tedious, exposition-heavy script to the thoroughly bizarre cast trapped in soulless roles, the $175-million "Jupiter Ascending" is an interesting, albeit clunky, mess until it ceases holding any appeal at all.
fresh	Caters to and simultaneously subverts the expectations of both the young adult and hardcore sci-fi/fantasy genres, and emerges victorious over both.
rotten	Somewhere between "wow!" and "huh?" resides "Jupiter Ascending," a nifty looking but ultimately joyless thrill ride that solidifies the siblings as the king and queen of overthinking sure things.
fresh	Jupiter Ascending feels like a truncated, Cliffs Notes version of something that might have worked a lot better as a mini-series. Two hours is too short for this tale and the end result suffers greatly because of that restriction.
rotten	The Wachowskis' vision has turned out to be kitsch: reheated tales of good v evil and interplanetary conflict, all dressed up in HR Giger-meets-RuPaul couture.
rotten	...concludes in a gigantic fireball of insignificance.
rotten	Even the best pulp sci fi cover needs to have something to grab you past that first page
rotten	[Jupiter Ascending] blends astonishing special effects work with plotting that would barely pass muster in a bad Saturday morning episode of Flash Gordon or Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
rotten	Visionaries often lose their way in their own visions. The majority of moviemakers and movies stick to outdated, predictable formulas and conventions. The Wachowskis, on the other hand, are not afraid to strand you early and often in Jupiter Ascending.
fresh	... the Wachowskis' true follow up to the Matrix series
rotten	It's hard to believe that a movie that contains this much exposition could also be this confusing, but it does and it is.
fresh	The good news is that Jupiter Ascending is actually not bad. But that's not the same as being great - or even good.
rotten	Even if you adore the idea of the Wachowskis, there comes a point when it would be foolish to deny the disappointing reality. That point has arrived, and the film is called "Jupiter Ascending."
rotten	We should expect a little more from the Wachowskis than this.
fresh	It's all very chaotic and entertaining, like a bizarre cult sci-fi TV show that somehow survived a threat of mid-season cancellation.
fresh	It is Moonquake Lake.
rotten	"Jupiter Ascending" is the film equivalent of a baseball slugger unleashing a huge swing and missing.
rotten	The Wachowskis have collected their last blank check from The Warner Brothers
rotten	Considering some of the sci-fi dreck from Hollywood in the last couple of decades, Jupiter Ascending isn't that bad of a film, just one we have seen before in more interesting ways.
rotten	This is wonderfully imaginative when it comes to costume, art direction, special effects, spaceships and incidental alien creatures but stuck with old-hat character types and a resolutely unspecial storyline.
fresh	Jupiter Ascending is everything you'd expect from the siblings' first trip into orbit, a fun, inventive, visually stunning piece of space opera.
fresh	While the universe and lore are notably impressive, Jupiter Ascending doesn't quite reach the starry heights it aspires to.
fresh	The Wachowskis' newest science-fiction fantasy is a visual wonder and a big-screen delight, but it suffers from overly complicated storytelling in service of thin characters and redundant action sequences.
rotten	It plays out like a convoluted mix of The Princess Diaries meets The Fifth Element, with the siblings blending an overabundance of sci-fi premises and visuals.
rotten	Anyone hoping for the old Matrix magic to rematerialize (it's been 15 years) is due for more disappointment.
rotten	Without a doubt, Jupiter Ascending can be powerfully intriguing because it's such an unfiltered, ill-advised misfire, but this long-delayed project is an epic folly that will inspire plenty of snark.
rotten	A disappointing step backwards for the Wachowskis, who lose themselves in an over-designed, underdeveloped 'Star Wars'-style land grab in space.
fresh	You have to hand it to Lana and Andy Wachowski: they don't do things by halves.
rotten	Jupiter Ascending might be a bad movie, but at least it's an entertaining load of old cobblers. This is a hot mess space opera from start to finish.
rotten	Imaginative designs, but otherwise a rote CGI blockbuster that takes no chances narratively, cinematically or philosophically.
fresh	There is no "up" in space, and there is no "the top" over which The Wachowskis will not go in Jupiter Ascending, a sci-fi saga that's convoluted and silly, but also exciting and enthralling over the course of its two-hours-and-change running time.
fresh	An over-stimulating, intergalactic odyssey evocative of The Wizard of Oz.
rotten	Another "Chosen One" story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious.
rotten	Blomkamp has retained his flare for gorgeous production design and interesting ideas, unfortunately with Chappie, those ideas are all recognizable from other, better pieces of entertainment.
rotten	Chappie, both the character and the film itself, is a clunky amalgam of mismatched parts.
rotten	A robot with consciousness gets lost in a junkyard of a movie
rotten	Blomkamp is clearly a man of ideas, but with the exception of District 9, he has been unable to fully articulate those ideas through character and action, a problem that is unfortunately confirmed by Chappie's muddled themes and misguided tonal shifts.
fresh	Superbly satisfying on many levels, Chappie might be one of the best movies of the year.
rotten	An astonishing, overstuffed mess, with at least two wholly different plotlines for two completely different movies.
fresh	Chappie the character is endearing enough to elevate Chappie the movie and help overcome some of the film's deficiencies.
rotten	This mash-up makes for a curious movie, one both beholden to its many sources of inspiration, and uncertain of how to use them to pave its way forward.
rotten	It's noisy, bloated, confused, derivative, singularly lacking in point and occasionally obnoxious. But at worst, it's just a forgettable mediocrity -- not some kind of crime against humanity.
rotten	The principal charm of the film arises from Chappie's ears, which prick up and droop like those of a titanium rabbit.
rotten	While not an entirely brainless experiment, too many scrap parts in the script lead Chappie and its cast astray
fresh	Three films into his career, Blomkamp has proven himself as a storyteller with a lot on his mind.
rotten	If only our hero were likable or emotionally compelling, viewers might be able to overlook Blomkamp's frenzied, overreaching plot.
rotten	Chops together familiar ideas and design from many far better features.
fresh	Blomkamp's strength lies in his unabashed populism, an extension of his sympathy with the underdog.
fresh	Violent and disturbing, especially in the implications of its quite brilliant final twist.
rotten	Neill Blomksmp's stylish heavy-metal hardware short-circuits into chaos.
fresh	The emotional power of Chappie's portrayal makes it stirring to watch but it just doesn't feel like enough care was taken with the rest of the film surrounding the robot.
rotten	With 'Chappie,' Blomkamp doesn't have a lot to say, which leaves us with a movie that is all shell and no heart.
fresh	The robot Chappie is brought to life awesomely by actor Sharlto Copley and the boffins at WETA, and much of your tolerance for the film will hinge on whether you find Die Antwoord endearing or not.
fresh	The robot works, and so, too, does Blomkamp's movie.
fresh	[Blomkamp is] back on track with Chappie, the latest in a long line of films about how artificial intelligence inevitably morphs into something far beyond what its Makers -- er, programmers -- intended, sometimes with a sinister turn, sometimes not.
rotten	A film about a machine gaining sentience is going to live or die on selling that central idea, and when it comes to the Turing test, Chappie fails miserably.
fresh	I liked the actors and characters in this film. While some are simple, others are more complex and they evolve. The plot has holes in it, but I was willing to overlook them because the characters are worth following.
rotten	It's a film that knows and loves science-fiction cinema: its grimy dystopian milieu and social conscience marries it, perhaps too closely, to the director's previous films.
rotten	For what it is, "Chappie" has its entertaining bits and will appeal to the younger crowd - not too young since it is rated "R" - but it is too cliched and redundant for me.
rotten	An uneven showcase of impeccable visual effects and lackluster emotional affect.
rotten	The execution of the Chappie character is idiotic, Blomkamp trying to wring laughs out of a robot that spews pidgin-gangster jargon and swaggers while clutching its groin.
fresh	"Chappie, Blomkamp's third film, is a mess. However it's a fascinating, occasionally glorious one that feels, for better or worse, a grimier, more personal movie from the South African director."
rotten	Neill Blomkamp, a maker of science fiction, has so many cool ideas jammed into his movies that coherence becomes a problem.
rotten	While the visual effects are spectacularly seamless, they're in the service of a movie which devolves from vaguely funny to just-plain silly to numbingly gory.
fresh	Here comes the elevator pitch: it's Three Men and a Baby meets Short Circuit via Robocop minus the satire. Bonkers, right? Wait, come back!
rotten	Countless problems plague this misfire by South African director Neill Blomkamp, but above all it's the total incredulity of the narrative concerning the development of the robotic Chappie that crushes it to rubble
rotten	Modern fairy tale, vision of sci-fi dystopia or dark comedy; like the identity crisis of the film's robot, Chappie suffers from not knowing what it wants to be and a script full of dialog for simpletons and nonsensical moments galore doesn't help
rotten	"Chappie" is one of those movies that's forgettable before you even leave the theater.
rotten	Enough with the futuristic plots --- maybe Blomkamp and Tatchell should utilize their talents in a completely different arena.
rotten	Too tonally conflicted to engage our sympathies.
rotten	Chappie's a mechanised Jar Jar Binks.
rotten	Too enthralled by the urgent rush of scenario to pause for the contemplation. It is one of those movies that reacts before it thinks.
rotten	...an R-rated fairy tale with...technology as magic. While 'Chappie' is easy to love, his film fails to elicit the same emotion.
rotten	With a sharper, more satirical script, it might have worked. Which is to really say Chappie kind of sucks.
fresh	There are some great ideas here but they are sadly undermined by a script with a fluctuating level of intelligence.
rotten	Like the director's previous films, it offers intriguing ideas and cool visuals before completely falling apart as a story.
rotten	There are flashes of genius in this recycled robot movie but if feels like Blompkamp is running worryingly short of ideas.
rotten	You may find yourself wanting every character in this thing to die horribly. And quickly.
rotten	It looks like writer-director Neill Blomkamp might be a one-trick pony ... and that one trick was District 9.
rotten	..most of the tonal choices made to flesh this out are disastrous.
fresh	...this film surprised the heck out of me...a lot of action but is still appealing and humorous at the same time, with some sub-themes of personal identity and the ability to take control of one's own existence.
fresh	Vince can't sell his robot to the police because -- get this -- it has too many guns. Bring that bad boy to America, dude. We'll have it inside day care centers in a week.
rotten	There's material in Chappie for a worthwhile motion picture but too little is explored by Blomkamp to make this worth a trip to a theater.
fresh	Chappie succeeds in Blomkamp's goal: exploring a heightened version of childhood development told through the lens of gritty science-fiction and gangster stereotypes.
rotten	One of the most miserable movie experiences of my life.
rotten	Chappie is the second movie in a row in which Blomkamp fails at both social commentary and basic storytelling.
rotten	It may be too sloppy and indulgent to actually call good, but that still leaves room for words like heartfelt, trippy, personal, and even admirable.
rotten	[Blomkamp's] playground here is the same grubby Johannesburg of District 9, but now he's unable to populate it with anything other than the most cliched, grotesque gaggle of dipshits.
fresh	As with District 9, the interaction between the title character and his human co-stars is seamless and absolutely real... In fact, the film's visuals are its primary achievement.
rotten	The film has a sly sense of humor and style to spare; the production design seamlessly integrates futuristic tropes and industrial decay. It just collapses in the third act.
rotten	Blomkamp stages engaging action sequences, but his film's tone switches from violence to campy to drama with dizzying frequency, as the story bounces from interesting, to predictable, to highly illogical, to just plain dumb.
rotten	Uncommonly annoying. Chappie tries to combine the silly sweetness of Short Circuit with the grim, violent satire of RoboCop, and that proves to be as disastrous as it sounds.
rotten	Blomkamp revs the pace up to keep weaknesses from showing, but that doesn't work.
fresh	Chappie is an ambitious futuristic epic that struggles to balance its more philosophical elements with Blomkamp's cartoonish instinct to blow everything to smithereens. Not exactly subtle but still a watchable guilty pleasure.
rotten	As I listened to all this, and periodically checked how much time was left, I couldn't help reflecting that where I come from, Chappie is a dog's dinner.
fresh	The dialogue is simplistic but the film is atmospheric and fitfully entertaining, thanks largely to the charms of Visser and Sharlto Copley, who plays Chappie via motion capture.
fresh	I didn't think there was room in my heart for another kind-bot-in-a-cruel-world. I was wrong.
rotten	This is a huge disappointment considering the ability that Blomkamp has; it's one bad film and I won't overreact...but fans of the "Alien" franchise that he has been taksed to revive might just want to stick with "District 9" and "Elysium".
rotten	Jackman and Patel are largely wasted in their one-note roles, and you'll barely notice Sigourney Weaver
rotten	This is a well-meaning film with a good idea that unfortunately stumbles on its way to its less-than-satisfying end.
rotten	One of those incongruous Franken-films that's simultaneously bombastically brutal and treacly.
fresh	This is Neill Blomkamp's best film since District 9. Despite this being a film that revolves around robots and artificial intelligence, Chappie is one of the most pure, genuine, and heartfelt films to come along this year.
rotten	It's cluttered, goofy and incoherent from beginning to end, and much too long.
rotten	makes the "Transformers" look charming in comparison.
rotten	Change the second letter of the title and you'll have a pretty good description of 'Chappie.'
fresh	'Chappie' has a strong first reel and a satisfying conclusion. (Director Neill) Blomkamp should have sought rewrites and an editor for the sequences in between.
rotten	Underwhelming robot sci-fi thriller is really violent.
rotten	Movies about human-like robots are plentiful and director Neill Blomkamp, who is known for his dystopian stories of the future, adds nothing new to the narrative - except a killer mullet from Hugh Jackman.
fresh	There's something fearlessly uncool about the film, which suffers mostly from being made 30 years too late.
fresh	"Chappie" takes a step back, and rather than pointing an angry finger at human greed, brutality and cowardice, it turns around and suggests that compassion is far more powerful.
rotten	At one point, an anguished Chappie screams out "Why do you humans do this?"-while he is theoretically commenting on the inhumanity of man at this point, I couldn't help but think of it as his plaintive comment on the film as a whole.
fresh	All told, the film has a lot of entertainment value, even if it leaves you feeling somewhat unsatisfied.
rotten	Chappie is a clunky mix: a sentimental comedy-thriller with hideous violence and a profound cynicism about the inexorability of the computer-enhanced surveillance state.
rotten	A loud and unpleasant "RoboCop" rehash that gives us no one to root for and nothing to think about.
rotten	RoboCopy
rotten	"Chappie" is all over the place, employing a cloying, "Patch Adams"-like sentimentality and abandoning logic at every turn.
fresh	Neill Blomkamp rips off themes from better flicks like RoboCop and Short Circuit, adds language, violence and his unique style. If it's your thing, it's not bad.
rotten	There is nothing original and interesting about Chappie. It's a hodgepodge of better science-fiction films from yesteryear whose films have been imitated countless times to no avail.
rotten	Blomkamp never shows authority with anything besides the fluid Chappie visual effects, biting off more than he can chew with this unpleasant, muddled, and unsatisfying actioner.
rotten	This offering not only suffers from a severe case of derivativeness, but sheer stupidity and an overall inability to engage the viewer beyond an occasional moment. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Jar Jar wept...
rotten	Chappie kind of looks like Johnny 5 on steroids! Sadly, the steroids have taken away all of his charm.
rotten	If Chappie director Neill Blomkamp's potential sinks any faster he'll be in M. Night Shyamalan territory before too long.
rotten	This admirable misfire is often endearing and Chappie is creatively designed and feels real, but an unsophisticated approach to its subject matter combined with the slight characterisations edges it perilously close to the scrapheap.
rotten	Low on meaning, but full of high-velocity chases, helicopter pursuits, and weapons blasting around empty warehouses marred by graffiti and trash.
rotten	I haven't been as happy to see a movie end since the third "Transformers."
fresh	Perhaps it's a good thing that Neill Blomkamp is moving on to direct an Alien sequel because he's in serious need of a change of scenery.
rotten	Ultimately, "Chappie" is about someone whom you know to have better instincts that you hope win out in the end. After this, you'll feel the same about Blomkamp. It's the kind of bad from which he can bounce back ... but damn, does it hurt to watch.
rotten	Sci-fi filmmaker Neill Blomkamp bolts together used and stolen parts for his robot movie Chappie, and the lamentable result is far from riveting.
fresh	Frustrating, Moving Chappie Is Engaging Despite Itself
rotten	There are some clever and provocative ideas about artificial intelligence swirling around in Chappie, the latest feature from the District 9 director Neill Blomkamp, but much of the film is derivative and messy.
rotten	Neill Blomkamp's choice of having Ninja and Yolandi Visser (or Vi$$er to be accurate), from the South African rap-rave band Die Antwoord, play, essentially, grotesque versions of themselves is disastrous -- a film-sinking folly.
fresh	The fact that the robot is more human than the humans is, to put it in computing terms, a bug, not a feature
rotten	Forget motion capture. This could have done with a bit of emotion capture.
fresh	Even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making, a liberation journey that just isn't the same old, same old when a director was born in South Africa.
fresh	Blomkamp embeds his movie-ostensibly about corporate robot cops taking over crime control in a slightly futuristic Johannesburg-in the music, art and attitude of Ninja and Yo-landi Visser, playing exaggerated versions of their personas in Die Antwoord.
rotten	Chappie struggles not to overplay its philosophical questions, but at the expense of never really letting them land.
rotten	Just when the movie seems to be hitting its stride, Blomkamp and Tatchell fall back on the reliable and the expected.
fresh	A techno thriller about the life of a sentient robot on the mean streets of Johannesburg
rotten	It's just a shame that poor Chappie is stuck in a patchwork collection of cliches and, one can only presume, aspects from Blomkamp's favorite '80s sci-fi films.
fresh	There are some plot-twisting musings on mortality and the soul that are thoughtful, sure. But they aren't thought through half as fully as Blomkamp's ultraviolent battle choreography.
fresh	Never mind that Weaver and Jackman are totally wasted or the laughable lapses in logic, or that it lacks the social resonance of District 9. It's a fun little ride, for at least part of the way.
rotten	Chappie, the robot, gets smart. Chappie, the movie, stays very, very dumb.
rotten	the contrived, confusing mess that's the result speaks volumes for Blomkamp's future in film... as of now, he's fresh out of original ideas
rotten	Like Chappie, the movie seems human, but has a cold metal heart.
rotten	"Chappie" is a movie about the evolution of artificial intelligence that's as dumb as a post. It also marks the continuing devolution of the work of director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp.
rotten	Chappie sets itself up to be a truly breathtaking study of robot and human relations, but just fails to move or compel the audience.
rotten	"Chappie" is as subtle as a sledgehammer. The latest sci-fi action spectacle from "District 9" and "Elysium" director Neill Blomkamp is also sprawling, bombastic, deafening, ugly and ultra-violent.
rotten	There are some nice special-effects here, and great production design, but Blomkamp forgot to give us any characters to latch onto.
rotten	The concept is undeniably compelling, but portions of this dystopian action thriller begin to feel like a video game.
rotten	Like Elysium, this rusty A.I. story is basically just District 9 with a new coat of paint; it's distinguished only by the jabbering, irritating personality of its title character.
rotten	A giant step backward for this once promising filmmaker, a big, dumb blockbuster that's indistinguishable from so many others that roll off the Hollywood assembly line.
rotten	I'd hate to think that a machine could ever replace a film critic, but I'd be curious to know what Chappie would think of Chappie. So much about the film doesn't compute.
rotten	"Chappie" is sappy. There's a better rhyme but it's not a word used in family newspapers.
rotten	Sustains a lively tension between A.I.-smart and comic-book-outlandish until the outlandishness turns to frenzy, the action grows familiar and you yearn for a robot break.
rotten	... once the thrill of the accomplishment fades, it's apparent that Blomkamp the director has been failed by Blomkamp the writer.
rotten	Chappie himself is lovingly and realistically rendered, though his personality shifts so often and so fast that it's hard to know how we should feel about him.
rotten	A morally muddled mess that is convoluted in plot and appallingly simplistic in its themes. I am a sad geek today.
rotten	Featuring a lot of what we have come to expect from Blomkamp in both style and substance, the District 9 director's latest epic is high on heart but low on brains, forgetting that we actually need both to make life happen.
fresh	It's a megabudget backyard wrestling video about a robot rap ninja, and I like that.
rotten	Chappie once again falls short of Blomkamp's debut film, but he still deserves credit for telling an original sci-fi story rooted in real issues.
rotten	Sadly, Blomkamp's ideas feel depleted this time, dulled by repetition and other cinematic droids that stretch from HAL 9000 to Ultron. Instead of awe, we get E.T.-aww.
rotten	The special effects are incredible (especially given the relatively small budget), but the flat digital cinematography renders even the most technically impressive action sequence visually stale.
fresh	The little-robot-who-could is a combination of Sharlto Copley's performance capture work and visual effects artistry, and the end result is remarkable.That may well be enough for Blomkamp fans, but anyone else can expect to be disappointed by Chappie.
fresh	Whether you choose to view Blomkamp's vision of our future as inevitable or as a cautionary tale, Chappie, as with Blomkamp's other films before it, does an excellent job of making the pitfalls explicit.
rotten	The film's exasperating atonality washes out any legitimate idea about identity, education, nature versus nurture, or artificial intelligence that Neill Blomkamp hoped to evince.
rotten	Robot adopted by gangster rappers learns how to love in a bafflingly bad sci-fi outing from the director of District 9.
rotten	It's the audience that's being programmed [here] ... Blomkamp is an outrageously derivative filmmaker, but District 9 is a paragon of originality next to Chappie.
fresh	So kinetic, so captivatingly crackerjack that attention deficit is no danger for the audience even if it is for the artist.
rotten	It's not an interesting failure, it's not over-ambitious - CHAPPIE is just a bad movie.
rotten	If Bono directed films, he'd be Neill Blomkamp.
rotten	With a titanium body and a child's mind, Chappie is a fascinating figure, vividly rendered, enough so that you wish there was a better movie around him.
fresh	Coming on at times like District 9.5, Blomkamp's third movie has just about enough spectacle and quirk to overcome some fairly major flaws, not least of which is an unappealing central trio.
rotten	Another M. Night Shyamalan is the last thing we need, and the first thing coming to mind as Neill Blomkamp's career continues with Chappie. It doesn't take a sixth sense to detect a similar flameout in progress.
rotten	By the time the plot skitters completely off the rails, that Chappie is Blomkamp's best movie is compelling evidence that he shouldn't be the one making them.
fresh	Like its title character, Chappie is stunning to behold and easy to like, but it's still some way from fully developed.
rotten	A misjudgment from metallic head to titanium toe.
fresh	That you can't quite say exactly what "Chappie" means, but you know and feel that it means something, tells you that it's operating on a level beyond consciousness. It's what makes it a work of art.
rotten	Developments become increasingly implausible, even for the world Blomkamp has created. Jackman grows increasingly cartoonish, Weaver is wasted and Patel just sort of exists ...
fresh	This is a terrific small film about artificial intelligence wrapped within a much bigger, less involving action blockbuster.
rotten	Comes across like a work in progress that no sane viewer would wish any closer to completion
rotten	By the end of this weird and whizzing picture, the only resonant thing is the echo of a film that could have been.
rotten	Blomkamp's a far better observer of technological behavior than human behavior; he understands design, but not designers.
fresh	Technically auspicious and socially conscious as only writer-director Neill Blomkamp can be, "Chappie" is exceedingly easy to admire if a little more difficult to fully embrace.
rotten	Can't seem to put the pieces together properly, and Chappie ends up being [Blomkamp's] weakest work yet.
fresh	...a welcome addition to the long and rich history of the robot in science fiction films.
rotten	An uneasy mix of action and philosophy, with simplistic notions of good and evil and mother love proving to be a distraction from the main event.
rotten	Blomkamp's third straight sci-fi thriller with a social conscience fails to reach its concept's ambition with much intelligence or insight.
fresh	Often riveting and always entertaining.
rotten	The picture isn't good enough to earn my full-throated defense. A half-hearted defense will have to do.
fresh	After the disappointment of Elysium, Blomkamp is back on his game.
fresh	A brawny, inventive action romp that's as happy firing rockets at helicopters as it is contemplating the Cartesian model of mind-body dualism.
fresh	Chappie may not scale the heights of Blomkamp's Oscar-nominated debut District 9, but it's still an enjoyable blockbuster that's stylishly-made and doesn't scrimp on entertainment value.
fresh	With its stunning urban landscapes, trash-talking titanium hero and mulleted, God-bothering bad guy (Hugh Jackman, never better), this is hugely entertaining.
fresh	Neill Blomkamp's latest sci-fi spectacular plays a little bit more like a retro mash-up than a fresh and exciting melody. But hey, at least it was mixed by Die Antwoord.
rotten	Excruciating...They gave the "Alien" franchise to this guy?
rotten	Dodgy as it is, there's a nobility and honor to 'Chappie.' Like Copley's probably divisive but game turn, it's committed to a vision.
fresh	Between the charming Copley performance, the ingenious visuals, the absolutely incredible all-electronic Hans Zimmer score, and the propulsive narrative thrust, there is a lot to appreciate and even love about "Chappie."
rotten	You'll be told repeatedly in whispers and shouts, that Chappie has feelings. It's too bad that neither the philosophy nor the pyrotechnics on-screen in "Chappie" can distract you from your own sinking feeling that you've seen almost all of this before.
rotten	Chappie is a bucket of bolts, Blomkamp's desire to say meaningful things outdistancing his ability to say them compellingly.
rotten	After the surprise and promise of District 9, this represents a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp in the wake of the highly uneven Elysium.
rotten	A robot-themed action movie that winds up feeling as clunky and confused as the childlike droid with which it shares its name.
fresh	It's most insightful in the presentation of its subject's iconic pictures and how it shapes his philosophy and artistic approach.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth travels to the heart of darkness, but thankfully comes out on the other side and leaves you with a hopefulness that no matter what kind of madness and repression happen in the world, there is still hope for humanity.
fresh	Stunning imagery and a stirring story, about Sebastiao Salgado and his 40-odd years of shooting global catastrophe.
fresh	The ubiquitous "Ken Burns effect" of panning and zooming across still images is mercifully absent here. The result feels more like an exhibit.
fresh	"The Salt of the Earth" presents not just a passing of time through one man's remarkable life but a change of perspective.
fresh	Whether capturing human anguish or natural wonders, Salgado has an eye for the transcendent.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth is many things: beautiful, horrifying, moving, stunning. But at its heart, it's deeply humanistic.
fresh	The authenticity and artistry of the images in "The Salt of the Earth" cannot be denied. In any context, they'd be unforgettable.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth is a celebration of the power of art to change the world, as well as an exploration of the considerable toll gifted artists sometimes pay for their talents.
fresh	It presents us with the portrait of a man who started out as an economist, discovered his vocation, travelled the world, immersed himself in his self-imposed task and encountered extremes of human behaviour.
fresh	There is, ironically, a kind of raw beauty in many of these images, even the ones that portray human suffering and death at its most grotesque.
fresh	The Salt Of The Earth is nothing short of fascinating, intimate and moving; yet at times, it's a bleak and often harrowing journey that exposes both the strength and weakness of mankind.
fresh	The film takes its time, and even seems to meander in places. But in retrospect, the path becomes clear: winding steadily towards home.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth, has the power to draw you into its world, transfix, and perhaps eventually transform you.
fresh	Direct-to-camera testimonials are the movie's troubled heart, and raise the inescapable question of what happens to a soul when it gets to the point where it's simply seen too much.
fresh	The film is at times too much in awe of its subject, failing to seriously address oft-expressed criticism that Salgado is a voyeur of global pain. But he's willing to get his hands dirty for real change.
fresh	The combination of talents and temperaments of two great artists makes for a work of such beauty and depth that is, indeed, breathtaking.
fresh	It is a fascinating film, and if it skimps somewhat on the moral complications of this kind of art, it holds nothing back in terms of volume: Image after image grabs our eye and often grips our throat.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth lets us look for a long time and consider Sebastiao Selgado's photography in the same way Selgado might
fresh	This moving, Oscar-nominated documentary is an odyssey of a tragic observer.
fresh	For this career-spanning documentary, director Wim Wenders accompanies the photographer on his travels, the color documentary footage punctuated by Salgados's stunning, minutely detailed black-and-white images.
fresh	There are just as many breathtaking moments to be found in the film as there are in the work it's about.
fresh	Is what we see grief porn or an epic, careerlong study in the best and worst we can find on Earth? See the film and decide for yourself.
rotten	The Salt of the Earth is too stagnant on its own terms...
fresh	Two masters meet, the result is glorious, rich with the contradiction of Salgado's work: beautiful images of the terror of man's suffering on earth.
fresh	The Salt of the Earth is a unique exhibition of beautiful photography, with immaculately filmed glimpses into social issues photographer Sebastiao Salgado's thoughts and process.
fresh	Wenders, hoping to illuminate not just these images but the man who made them, has found an intriguing way to capture both Salgado and his work simultaneously.
fresh	... a picture of the brutal life of survival in the worlds far beyond our shores...disasters, international conflicts, starvation, and exodus, even showing the Zo'e tribe hunting in the uncharted rainforest...a mesmerizing film not to be missed.
fresh	Given this fractured-three-ways perspective, it's surprising how smoothly The Salt of the Earth moves, how gracefully it switches back and forth between the personal and the objective.
fresh	Most of the photographs on view in The Salt of the Earth bear witness to great suffering, and what they exalt is not the photographer's eye but the fearful humanity that binds us all.
rotten	It looks lovely, yet Wenders' worshipful account of Salgado the man feels like a tale half told.
fresh	Years are of necessity telescoped into a hundred nine cinema minutes, through selected representative images.
fresh	Wenders trains his camera on photographer Sebastiao Salgado and the result, though not without flaws, is an invigorating and interesting observation of the man, his work and the entire medium of photography.
fresh	The film is suffused with his anguish over the state of our species, and our planet. Yet it ends with a change of heart and a turn of events that make a plausible case for hope.
fresh	In lesser hands, The Salt Of The Earth could have been indistinguishable from a magazine or online multimedia profile, with no specific life as a film.
fresh	Wenders's reverent enthusiasm for his subject is evident throughout the film, and he details every chapter of Salgado's life with an acolyte's inability to separate the wheat from the chaff.
fresh	The film is, in large part, a story of an artist rediscovering his muse.
fresh	With this heartbreaking yet hopeful new documentary about his life's work, Salgado shares the stories behind these split-second black-and-white moments, giving them even more dimension.
fresh	Wim Wenders delivers another generously appreciative fellow-artist collaboration with this luminous portrait of epic photographer Sebastiao Salgado.
fresh	In a sense this is another Wenders road movie, only it spans an entire life and winds up in locations even more far-flung than usual.
fresh	Many of the images - and Salgado's accounts of taking them - are as soul-shattering as they are breathtaking.
fresh	The movie Wenders and Juliano have made is a tribute that feels both grand and modest in scale: Just as Salgado's photographs do, it extends the notion of friends and family to include every citizen of the world.
fresh	It evolves into an intimate reverie on family and aesthetics, while remaining sporadically attuned to the reflexive and ethical dimensions of ethnographic discovery.
fresh	The documentary may skimp a little on the man, but his art is proudly front and center -- which, one suspects, is perhaps how he'd prefer it.
fresh	Magnificent! It's a dazzling documentary, filled with indelible imagery.
fresh	A voyage into the surreal that stays in the mind, the heart and the throat for many weeks to come.
fresh	If you want to know what it takes to be a world-class photographer, you don't want to miss this movie.
rotten	[Mr. Salgado's] pictures, precisely because they disclose harsh and unwelcome truths, deserve a harder, more robustly critical look.
fresh	Whether you're familiar with Salgado's name and work or not, the documentary "The Salt of the Earth," a popular prize-winner at Cannes and on the Oscar shortlist, will be a revelation.
fresh	A monumental documentary by Wim Wenders on the remarkable photography of Sebastiao Salgado whose work reveals a deep reverence for life.
fresh	The personal and the universal are combined in one, the very best that documentary can accomplish.
fresh	Quite simply the greatest film every made about the art of photography.
fresh	"The Salt of The Earth" is a mesmeric and unforgettable look at the world and it sufferings through the eyes of a remarkably insightful and honorable artist.
fresh	As a celebration of the photographic art of one remarkable contributor, The Salt of the Earth is unparallelled.
fresh	The documentary form seems to bring out the best in Wenders. The Salt Of The Earth is no exception ...
fresh	Wim Wenders confirms his mastery of the documentary form with this stunning ode to Sebastiao Salgado.
fresh	A moving tribute to a peerless talent.
fresh	Despite familiar narrative territory, the film has some big laughs and manages some authentic character dynamics.
rotten	Decent messages in tepid indie dramedy; language, drug use.
fresh	An indie comedy that gets by on the charm of its actors -- Nick Kroll, Rose Byrne and Bobby Canavale -- while asking nothing of its audience and doing nothing more than providing a pleasant 90-minute extension of Kroll's brand into movies.
rotten	A disappointingly familiar, albeit congenial, comedy.
fresh	"Adult Beginners" is one of those agreeable small-scale movies that doesn't seem particularly ambitious; its only goal is to charm, and it does so, irresistibly.
rotten	An extended sitcom with surprisingly little comic bite...just floats along on a current of bland affability.
fresh	"Adult Beginners" doesn't reinvent the comeuppance comedy, and it's a better movie because of it.
fresh	"Adult Beginners" has enough going on to work as a mostly unchallenging time-passer, and nothing more.
rotten	This film finds itself in an unfortunate spot in its involuntary thematic and release-date proximity to [The Skeleton Twins].
fresh	In other words, we're getting a nice, well-written, solid movie about people we believe would actually exist in real life.
fresh	...with as many successes that Adult Beginners has-and they have plenty-there are a number of small flaws that hold it back.
rotten	It's a sitcom setup that husband-and-wife screenwriters Jeff Cox and Liz Flahive manage to (almost) cover with a fresh coat of funny and touching.
rotten	has the misfortune of being an awful lot like last year's Sundance hit "The Skeleton Twins" without nearly as many laughs.
fresh	If you're a big booster of any of the lead actors (I'm something of a Cannavale partisan myself), this will be worth your time.
fresh	Some movies deserve to be treasured, and 'Adult Beginners' is high on my list.
rotten	Every time it steps outside of its comfort zone to address more sophisticated feelings concerning maturation and grief, it loses its personality, resembling any other effort that takes on the pressures of man-child development.
fresh	The kind of comedy that goes down easy even as it looks at the hard stuff.
rotten	New ideas, people. Not asking too much here.
rotten	The director Ross Katz, making his feature directing debut, does occasionally move the camera around, but for the most part he just points and shoots his performers talking, joking, whining, sharing and caring.
rotten	The relative success or failure of "Adult Beginners," directed with a steady, nonjudgmental hand by Ross Katz, depends on how funny you find Kroll. I find him funny-ish.
rotten	Fittingly, the film has an adult beginning before slowly sinking into infantile platitudes.
fresh	It's all very low stakes. We know how this is going to turn out. But it is a pleasure watching Kroll and Byrne to the end.
rotten	A slightly sourish cocktail of bad behavior, wry observation, and commentary on how difficult modern life can be, especially for characters who feel entitled to a better one.
rotten	Yet in the end, Adult Beginners is sort of a mumblecore Jerry Maguire, albeit without the crowd-pleasing catchphrases and mega-watt star power.
rotten	The not-funny-enough dialogue can't mask writer Kroll's unoriginal plot. Still, he can smirk with the best of them.
rotten	Adult Beginners begins with a promise of lifelike spontaneity before it succumbs to rotely written domestic cliches: old wounds that must be healed, timely epiphanies and grossly personal affronts dismissed way too lightly.
rotten	The early scenes are acidly funny... By the end, though, this has turned into a Tim Allen movie.
fresh	It's harmless and mild and likable, but it's also a toothless comedy that should have had some bite.
fresh	Like last year's equally promising The Skeleton Twins, it soars whenever it sticks to persuasively lived-in sibling banter (Rose Byrne is sharp as ever).
rotten	It glides along the surface where conversations that include the question "Are you really happy?" pass for bonding.
rotten	Adult Beginners has a lot of missteps and it doesn't seem to know where it's going. For me, it's going in the "never watching again" pile.
rotten	Given its played-out subject matter and hoary coming-to-terms narrative arc, one's ability to enjoy the film hangs on a tolerance for the ever-popular on-screen man-child.
rotten	Neither dramatic enough to qualify as drama nor amusing enough to completely succeed as comedy, it's the kind of movie that coasts on pleasantness, content to elicit a few smiles before disappearing from memory banks.
rotten	If men-children like Jake don't outgrow telling their stories, their crib will feel like an artistic prison.
rotten	There's never any doubt on the audience's part to rival that felt by the characters in their own lives.
fresh	The cozy look at sibling relationships will remind many of last year's The Skeleton Twins, which like this was produced by the Duplass Brothers.
rotten	The pleasant but forgettable "Adult Beginners" strains a bit too hard for a happy ending, and tends to lay on the schmaltz and metaphors (like the swim class that gives the film its title) with a trowel.
fresh	Married-in-real-life screenwriters Liz Flahive and Jeff Cox can do poignant (not tossing family memorabilia) and clever (connecting Skype, hairspray, and stepparents), though the humor is intermittent.
rotten	An exhausting, predictable bit of tear-jerker fluff with a handful of decent scenes. It's the type of film people who don't take film seriously think is really edgy.
rotten	This comedy-drama never puts a foot wrong. And yet, its stakes are so low, its setup so familiar, that the film's generally effortless flow starts to become a hindrance.
rotten	Perhaps it could have benefited from a little more of the comedic energy and subversive spirit that Bryne, Kroll and Cannavale have all proved more than capable of in previous roles.
rotten	Another indie comedy seemingly inspired by Robert Frost's verse from "The Death of the Hired Man" about how "home is the place where, when you go there, they have to take you in," "Adult Beginners" has everything going for it aside from a reason to exist.
rotten	The blandness of Adult Beginners' characters and story makes it feel much longer than its 90 minutes.
rotten	Amusing, here and there, but entirely too predictable -- especially in casting Kroll as a classic Nick Kroll Summer's Eve sort of character.
rotten	Likable but slight.
fresh	Kroll and Byrne find a palpable sense of care for one another. It helps that Kroll can use his face as well as any actor to draw laughs from the audience, and Byrne can illicit empathy and compassion with her gentle, plaintive eyes.
fresh	A movie worth checking out for the performances, but certainly not for anything else, unfortunately.
fresh	Warm, believable performances by this ensemble.
fresh	A wonderfully cast dramedy about brothers and sisters, growing up, and taking responsibility.
fresh	Adult Beginners feels more like a baby-step in figuring out how [Nick] Kroll will transition to film star, but the potential is certainly there.
fresh	Every arc and every twist is predictable from the get-go and the stakes are pretty low given the circumstances. But, there's something truly cozy about this picture. It's comfort food.
fresh	Adult Beginners benefits from a strong cast that showcases Nick Kroll's ability to blend cynicism and drama, despite working with a story that only offers a few new insights.
fresh	An affable (for the most part) little comedy...
fresh	Rose Byrne and Nick Kroll play a sibling duo navigating their shared and respective crises in this warmly appealing dramedy.
fresh	It's not perfect, but as far as feature debuts go, there's very little you can fault "Adult Beginners" for. Slightly pedantic and maudlin at times, with telegraphed metaphors and rushed pacing, it's still hard to call any of these hiccups major flaws.
fresh	The werewolves you can accept, the humans you can tolerate, but the Christians?
fresh	This duo knows that comedy comes not just from mocking tropes but from mocking the scruffy human pretensions that give birth to them.
fresh	Waititi and Clement pry open the coffin lid and unleash a box-fresh, fang-sharp comedy which goes straight for the jugular.
fresh	"What We Do in the Shadows" is a laugh riot, but by humanizing its characters, it proves to provide a bit of life to those we've seen as nothing but dead.
fresh	Taps a fresh vein of humor to transfuse the horrific and the mundane.
fresh	If Twilight made you queasy and Dark Shadows felt like a missed opportunity, this pitch-perfect genre spoof is worth relishing.
fresh	A movie of biting humor, in the literal sense, but the blood it draws is purely decorative.
fresh	Expertly paced, consistently inventive, and exceedingly good natured. Especially when the splatter is hitting the rafters.
fresh	I'm so sick of vampires I'd have pounded a stake into my own heart not to have to watch this, but it turns out to be a pitch-perfect spoof of MTV's The Real World and a sly satire on millennial slackerdom.
fresh	The New Zealand-made art comedy What We Do in the Shadows is a bracing reminder of how the right burst of energy and style breathes fresh ideas into a genre threatened with creative exhaustion.
fresh	If we see two or three more comedies this year that know what they're doing the way this one does, it'll be a very good year indeed.
fresh	The tone -- deadpan, wistful, silly but never stupid -- is just right and puts "What We Do in the Shadows" next to "This Is Spinal Tap" as a mockumentary that shows its subjects as human -- in this case, inhuman -- in their hopes and fears.
fresh	Maybe it's something in the water Down Under, but these fellows have managed to concoct a whole new perspective on fangsters.
fresh	Even when the laughs are less frequent, they continue through to the end, with plenty of quotable lines.
fresh	Imagine my delight at finding Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi's What We Do in the Shadows thoroughly entertaining, amusing and even charming.
fresh	We actually start to care about these ridiculous characters because, like the rest of us, they're just trying to survive the inanities of everyday life ... and keep the carpets free of unsightly gore stains.
fresh	Like the mock-doc tone, the vampire parody feels worn out, though the production shows its affection for the tradition and insight about the recent genre.
fresh	Superbly written with sharp humor, fantastic characters, and a well-polished story completely in tune with its source material, What We Do in the Shadows is an uproarious horror comedy that's every bit as funny as Shaun of the Dead.
fresh	Lots to love here. The directors match a universally loved topic with an undertone about life in a very remote city, reflecting the poignant side of being undead in an unlively town.
fresh	In the spirit of This Is Spinal Tap, writer/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi take us inside the lives of modern-day Wellington vampires and show us that the undead have problems, too.
fresh	Darkly, edgily funny, the mockumentary about four nocturnal, bloodsucking flat-mates in Wellington, New Zealand reduced me to a quivering laugh zombie. It's MTV's Real World meets Hammer Horror with a nod to Christopher Guest.
fresh	Tell your friends you saw the next comedy cult classic before anyone else ...
fresh	A vampire mockumentary that bites into the same vein of Spinal Tap comedy and cranks it up to eleven.
fresh	[T]he filmmakers and the cast have created a world and characters that not only provide opportunities for humor but also evolve with it.
fresh	A send-up of the vampire mythos that's affectionate and genial.
fresh	Shadows takes what could have been a one-joke sketch and turns it into a very funny, and occasionally even touching, take on brotherhood and friendship...It's certainly more authentic and realistic than recent seasons of The Real World.
fresh	"What We Do in the Shadows" is bloody awesome.
fresh	While it's hardly a genre mile-, er, tombstone, What We Do in the Shadows is cleverly executed throughout and occasionally inspired in its affectionate silliness.
fresh	There is so much love and understanding of all the genres the film is skewering that "What We Do in the Shadows" transcends its lowbrow inspirations. It's a real treat.
fresh	Hilarious, with refreshing attention to the gruesome possibilities of the premise, "Shadows" is a creative step forward for Waititi, taking interesting tonal risks while maintaining a steady flow of silly business.
fresh	Brings warmth to its silliness, underscoring its sense of humor with the loneliness of characters doomed to watch their loved ones die.
fresh	The concept could wear thin, but it manages to stay fresh and utterly hilarious. Deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap.
fresh	The highest compliment to pay this film is to note that it's one of the best Christopher Guest movies that Guest never made.
fresh	...mixes the documentary format with fantasy elements to create some fantastically funny stuff.
fresh	Finally! A vampire movie that doesn't suck!
fresh	... the funniest horror spoof since 'Shaun of the Dead' ... Our Down Under hosts are less interested in creeping us out than in introducing us to the most charmingly dotty homebodies since the Addamses.
fresh	The actors are in character and in sync with the mockumentary brand of deadpan.
fresh	Pleasingly thorough and inventive in its treatment of a well worn subject, and quietly smart about dealing with the way things can change over a few hundred years.
fresh	It's a cheerfully horrific affair, a sanguine comedy that feels more than a bit like a Christopher Guest farce or an elaborate Monty Python sketch, imprinted with the Kiwi comic sensibilities of co-directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.
fresh	It is fresh, clever and, most importantly, riotously funny.
fresh	No deep meaning or social relevance, only welcome diversion from these troubled times-i.e. superbly silly fun.
fresh	It's good bloody fun just hanging out with the vamps at their house, listening to them squabble, watching them make pottery ...
fresh	A farce nearly on a par with "Zoolander" (2001), "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," (2006) and that gold standard of inanity, "Three Amigos!" (1986).
fresh	You've got to love a thing to skewer it as thoroughly as Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement do in their delightfully silly vampire mockumentary "What We Do in the Shadows."
fresh	It's funny because of the absurdity of vampires in this context. And it's funny because the context itself is hackneyed to begin with, even if we've never thought so until now.
fresh	A surprisingly delicate vampire spoof that's both hilarious and respectful, and that captures all the silliest, scariest and saddest aspects of the bloodsucking tradition in one delicious package.
fresh	Any longer and it might overstay its welcome, but as is it's perfect, in its own deceptively unassuming way.
fresh	... loaded with inspired sight gags and deadpan one-liners.
fresh	This isn't a blunt-edged satire like the egregious 2010 flop Vampires Suck. The humor is light, sweet, and silly, and never burdened by the trendiness of its conceit.
fresh	Even though mockumentaries and vampires have both been done to death, the movie still manages some good ideas -- and a few hearty laughs.
fresh	"What We Do in the Shadows" is an irrepressibly charming B-movie that never over-stays its welcome, and is both conceptually clever and admirably well-executed.
fresh	An early montage gives a historical representation of each of the four housemates, showing how the bloodsuckers ended up in New Zealand, several group photos worthy of their own prequels.
fresh	Like a Christopher Guest movie with a widow's peak, What We Do in the Shadows depicts a supposed "New Zealand Documentary Board" film gone gruesomely, hilariously awry.
fresh	Just when it looked like the vampire genre had been bled dry, along comes the insanely inspired horror-satire "What We Do in the Shadows" to give it fresh bite.
fresh	At heart a dotty look at oldsters struggling to adapt to an unwelcoming modernity, "Shadows" has the bones of an anarchic sitcom.
fresh	What We Do In the Shadows leaps to the top of the pack, by resolutely sticking to deadpan humour and absurd riffs on the awkwardness of being a vampire in a world made for humans.
fresh	So smart and perceptive about the quotidian ups and downs of its protagonists' lives that it's almost a jolt when, say, they start levitating off the ground or get into a passive-aggressive argument with a pack of werewolves.
fresh	As zom-coms go, though, this one brings a unique bite to proceedings.
fresh	The film not only tweaks the vampire genre by adding a number of mumblecore elements, but also pays a tongue-in-cheek homage to its history.
rotten	What We Do in the Shadows is a perfectly pleasant romp, even if its attempts to have a plot weigh it down.
fresh	Any movie that makes you laugh this hard (even if only sporadically) deserves the shower of praise that's been heaped upon it.
fresh	It succeeds not because it gets the dead-ghoul stuff right (sudden flights, tomb bedrooms, Lestat-like wardrobes), but because it sends up the true-life genre that just won't die.
fresh	What We Do In The Shadows is wonderfully dry and irreverent, playing out something like True Blood by way of Waiting For Guffman.
fresh	Comedy is a very subjective thing and I can imagine people who won't find What We Do in the Shadows funny. But I can't imagine that they have happy lives.
fresh	More often amusing than gut-busting, but it doesn't wear out its welcome, and that's fairly impressive in itself.
fresh	Is this New Zealand mockumentary just one comedy sketch stretched to movie length? Maybe. But when the aging vampires hit the town to party with werewolves, zombies and humans, you won't be able to wipe the smile off your face.
rotten	Most of the best gags are in the early going and the film seems ever more stretched and thin as it goes on. It would have made a brilliant eight-minute sketch, though.
fresh	A deadpan one-joke vampire mockumentary that wrings every possible laugh out of that one joke.
fresh	A fresh, unexpected and welcome take on vampires-from New Zealand, of all places.
fresh	Proves that some tropes, like the undead and roommate problems, are eternally funny.
fresh	Waititi and Clement bring to the material the same deadpan, straight-faced sensibility that paid such rich dividends in Flight Of The Conchords.
fresh	An endearingly dorky undead heart beats in this vampire mockumentary by two of the creators of HBO's "Flight of the Conchords."
fresh	What We Do in the Shadows is never as self-conscious as you fear it might be, and it has some of the loose, wiggy energy of early Jim Jarmusch, only with more bite.
fresh	What We Do In The Shadows boasts the subtle wit of a Christopher Guest mockumentary without disregarding a vampire film's bloody nature, scoring memorable laughs through satire and gore alike.
fresh	While parodies and spoofs have a long cinematic history, rarely do such works possess this kind of narrative cohesion and emotional integrity.
fresh	I found myself cackling at "What We Do in the Shadows" like a witch with a helium balloon.
fresh	What We Do in the Shadows breathes new life into both the mock doc and horror spoof genres, two formats that have long been thought -- creatively anyway -- dead.
fresh	Genius.
fresh	If you're fan of vampires and vampire lore, there's no doubt you'll dig this. If these guys represent the voice for spoof movies moving forward, we're in a really good place.
fresh	Taps a rich vein of comedy.
fresh	The Kiwi team have brought a surprisingly fresh - and fetid - tone to this consistently amusing mockumentary.
rotten	While individual gags and cineliterate nods (from Nosferatu to Blade) may have comical bite, there's not enough meat to sink its feature-length fangs into.
fresh	There's little about the film you would call profound or sophisticated. But it has at least one very funny line a minute, and it's amazing what legs the basic joke has.
fresh	Aside from being flat-out hilarious, this vampire-themed reality TV spoof actually has some pungent things to say about friendship in the 21st century. Not that it's ever trying to make a point.
fresh	The film does repeat itself and seems a little stretched at feature length -- but there is plenty of hilarity along the way.
fresh	What We Do in the Shadows is the vampire mockumentary you've been longing for.
fresh	Among the tide of low-fi productions based around an amusing (or scary) concept and a couple of improvising actors, this smart, canny and often hilarious comedy truly stands out.
fresh	This delightfully deadpan spoof about a ragtag bunch of Kiwi vampires breathes new life into the mockumentary format.
rotten	Obvious, schoolboy humour amounts to very little indeed.
fresh	One of the funniest comedies of the year.
fresh	A full-blooded delight then.
fresh	After a while, I was embarrassed at myself for giggling so much.
fresh	Here it is at long last: a truly great vampire comedy. And also the funniest horror film to come out of New Zealand since Braindead.
fresh	Ultimately, this is just one joke stretched out, but thankfully for our resident filmmakers, it's a really bloody funny one.
fresh	An absolutely hilarious mockumentary combination of utter silliness, social satire, pop-culture cramdown, and heartfelt pathos. And vampires.
fresh	This isn't much more than a series of ridiculously dotty sketches, and might have worked better as a sitcom, but it's surprisingly hilarious.
fresh	An infectiously silly, frequently funny vampire mockumentary which is brought to life by a combination of impressive improvised dialogue, high-spirited performances and a keen knowledge of vampire mythology and motion pictures.
fresh	89 minutes of sharp mockumentary hilarity, exposing the oddest of horror motifs and myths to a puncturing modernity. And all this without a single fang pun...
fresh	Very funny, very silly.
fresh	Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary about the undead keeps the genre alive and well.
fresh	What We Do in the Shadows is a sharp little character-driven comedy that gets its laughs not so much from the plot but simply from its cast of weirdos.
fresh	The question should be, does it have a new thought, a new energy? I would say yes, even without the driving force of a real story. There are moments of unexpected grace, as well as visual invention.
fresh	Where this documentary shines is that it creates empathy for its subjects. It's not their fault that they were bitten centuries ago. They're just trying to make the best of the situation.
fresh	When there's no more room in hell, the dead will move to Wellington, apparently. Director Taika Waititi is joined behind the camera by Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement for the murderously funny mockumentary... This thing is a fiendish delight.
fresh	Filled with throw away humour and occasional LOL moments of the ghoulish kind, the film's technical achievements help audiences take it seriously while at the same time laughing along with the comedic ideas.
fresh	The biggest criticism of What We Do In The Shadows is that it's so unrelentingly funny that you'll miss half the jokes through laughing
fresh	Just like the addictive bloodlust these characters have, What We Do in the Shadows is a film that demands repeated viewings with its ever quotable dialogue and wacky situations where the supernatural meets the mundane to gut-busting results.
fresh	An instant classic ready for enduring cult success.
fresh	The tight 85 minutes has been ruthlessly pruned from many hours of improvisations.
fresh	Does for vampires what This is Spinal Tap did for rock bands.
fresh	More deadpan, clever, and silly than it is simple, "schticky," or mean-spirited.
fresh	Taikia Waititi and Jemaine Clement's rollicking mockumentary "What We Do in the Shadows" shows us that bloodsuckers have banal problems, too -- like getting along with roommates.
fresh	What We Do In the Shadows is the type of little movie that you watch and feel like you've discovered something really special. It's a total surprise; a silly, scary delight.
fresh	The funniest mockumentary film since Best In Show.
fresh	Like a lost Hammer horror film from the seventies, only intentionally funny.
fresh	It shouldn't work as well as it does, but funny is funny, and this one had me cracking up often...
rotten	Some genre fans who prefer the silly to the satiric may bite, but the anemic pic isn't remotely weird or witty enough for cult immortality.
fresh	However tired one may be of the mockumentary format, the shtick is well suited for this material; in fact, it's easy to imagine a straighter storytelling approach falling flat or playing like an Addams Family rip-off.
fresh	It's a provocative and jester-type of film that dares you to have a good time while it churns your guts.
fresh	There are plenty of satisfying moments throughout, enough that perhaps it's better to think about how this would play as a weekly series.
fresh	The film is a subversive satire that shines a light on the daily inequities that plague us, and the reality that most people simply either overlook, ignore or apathetically accept them.
fresh	Six apocalyptic Argentine stories of revenge combine in this hugely enjoyable and extreme anthology.
fresh	Narrative lapses notwithstanding, [director] Szifron's sense of timing and his immaculate control of tone cannot be doubted.
fresh	These tales don't overlap, but Wild Tales definitely felt like the closest thing to Pulp Fiction since Pulp Fiction.
fresh	There's a fine line between clever and smug, and Szifron rides that line hard, reveling in the brutality and explosive emotions on display.
fresh	Wild Tales isn't much interested in tender sensibilities -- rather, it trades in deliberately outraging those sensibilities in bleakly funny and anarchic ways.
fresh	The deft mix of tones keeps Wild Tales fresh and surprising.
fresh	Succeeds not only by being outrageously entertaining, but by functioning as a sort of hellish magic mirror ...
fresh	Made for modern-day moviegoers who don't want their films TOO messy (a la Un Chien Andalou, Multiple Maniacs or Eraserhead), Wild Tales is more often like mild tales, yet that's not necessarily a knock.
fresh	A splendidly anarchic portrait of a world on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
fresh	There are plot twists, to be sure, and some very polished filmmaking.
fresh	Very few films have been as appropriately titled as writer/director Damian Szifron's omnibus black comedy Wild Tales.
fresh	Each morsel of well-rounded, perfectly structured storytelling becomes part of a coherent, exuberant whole, linked as much as anything by a potent political anger directed against inequality and abuse, be it emotional, physical or economic.
fresh	Wild Tales is a riotously entertaining collection of short stories linked by a common theme: people losing their self-control and self-respect.
fresh	Wild Tales is a raucously entertaining collection of "six deadly stories of revenge". The brilliance of the film (produced by Pedro Almodovar) lies in its combination of excess and ordinariness.
fresh	Rather as if a collection of Roald Dahl's darker Tales Of The Unexpected had been re-set in an Argentina riddled with crime, petty corruption and crazy road rage ...
fresh	Portmanteau films are not that common, or usually successful, but Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron has fashioned a collection of six payback stories with visual flair and a wicked sense of humour.
fresh	What it is is a lot of fun, pulling a steady stream of I-can't-believe-I'm-laughing-at-that laughs out of the viewer.
fresh	From Argentina, this Oscar-nominated collection of six short, sharp stories leaves us gasping for breath due to both riotous black comedy and deeply unnerving plot twists...
fresh	Filmmaker Damian Szifron must have had a difficult childhood. Or else he just loves - don't we all? - dark stories in which logic is an extension ladder from Earth to Hell.
fresh	[Wild Tales] plays like a series of short stories as it delves into characters who finally give in to their rage. As you might expect, it doesn't always end well.
fresh	Broad strokes, dexterously delivered.
fresh	While it's boiling over, it's satisfyingly snippy fun - the movie equivalent of cutting three inches off a cheating ex's trousers.
fresh	Perversely entertaining.
fresh	How to discuss this giddily inventive Argentinian feature without ruining its many surprises?
fresh	A delicious chocolate box of nastiness.
fresh	This anthology of six bleakly funny shorts is a mixed bag that ranges from anticlimactic but intriguing to 'Oh my God, did I just laugh out loud at that?'
fresh	Of the six tales on offer, four are excellent and one decent - a high strike rate for a compilation.
fresh	The funniest of the six stories is a brilliantly extended riot of absurdly brutal road rage.
fresh	The film is not an advance, in themes or style, over such predecessors as the omnibus horror thrillers of the 1960s and '70s; but at its best it's a lot of fun, and it's filled with memorable performances and characters.
fresh	Like Tarantino's films, Wild Tales will rub some the wrong way by taking glee in the violence that comes from our worst selves, but the catharses have a positive social function...there's no doubt Szifron intends cautionary Tales.
fresh	Savage Humor, Bitter Irony at the Core of "Wild Tales."
fresh	Szifron brings everything to the table here: anger, rage, betrayal, malice aforethought and panic. But he leavens this with humor, style, cleverness and wit.
fresh	Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but the dark comedy Wild Tales (Relatos salvajes) argues that payback is more satisfying when it's doled out in fiery, bloody and outrageous doses.
fresh	Written and directed by Argentina's Damian Szifron, this brilliant black comedy will make you laugh or drive you crazy. Maybe a little of both.
fresh	A film like "Wild Tales" might be able to remind us that "an eye for an eye" leaves the whole world blind. Even if it doesn't, it's still a heck of a lot of fun to watch.
fresh	Wild Tales - Relatos salvajes in its original Spanish - is, indeed, savage. And surprising. Your jaw will drop, your head will shake, more than a few times.
fresh	"Wild Tales" has been described as a movie about revenge, but I'd refine that to say that the movie gives us variations on the theme of outrage, the world's most fashionable and contagious emotion.
fresh	Entertaining, over-the-top and more than a little anxiety-inducing.
fresh	Though the inventiveness tends to run down as the film runs on...Szidron's sextet remains intriguing to the end.
fresh	One of the most inventive, entertaining Foreign Language films of 2014.
fresh	Along the way, Szifron probes some interesting modern philosophical questions.
fresh	If everyone behaved the way the characters in Wild Tales behave, civilization would crumble. But the real take-away lesson here is how easy it might be for any of us, swept up in a moment of bloodlust, to consider pure raging hostility a fair trade.
fresh	By sugarcoating gratuitous violence with lethal doses of humor, Damian Szifron's eye-for-an-eye satire emerges equal measures fun, cathartic and enlightening.
fresh	Outrageous, rude, a refreshing change of pace.
fresh	A banquet of bad behavior.
fresh	Szifron gives us a window onto other people's worst impulses rather than a mirror reflecting our own; the laughs come fast and full, and they come a little too easily.
fresh	With the darkest of humour, it graphically illustrates what happens when the stress of 21st century living causes regular citizens to "go postal."
fresh	Some of it is funny, most of it is puzzling, but when Szifron locks into the weirdness of the moment, stacking coincidences and playing with puzzled reactions, "Wild Tales" finds a welcome shot of mischief.
fresh	While the film has all of the inconsistencies apparently native to the genre, what it has is a surly attitude, a scathing wit, and a fresh directing voice in Damian Szifron.
rotten	Maybe the first tale in Wild Tales is too strong ... It's so successful, in fact, that each of the following five stories pales by comparison.
fresh	The half-dozen chapters vary in length and subject matter, but not in style or the efficiency of their message.
fresh	With Wild Tales, Szifron announces himself as a talented molecular mix of Tarantino, Rodriguez, Spielberg and Almodovar with an eye for crisp editing and gorgeously composed widescreen imagery.
fresh	Each time one of the stories seems to zig when it should have zagged, here comes the zag, arriving with absurdity and logic and to coolly cruel conclusions.
fresh	A satirical masterwork. You don't need to be Argentine to get it; you simply must be a citizen of the world.
fresh	The nuances are perfectly articulated, the observations expertly perceived and the tragedies heart-wrenchingly realised.
fresh	A wickedly funny, perceptive and smart roller coaster ride of emotions that walks a fine line between comedy and tragedy.
fresh	Wild Tales is both great entertainment and great cinema, in that it sucks you in while also making you appreciate its skillful, inventive execution. This is, in every conceivable way, an exhilarating film.
fresh	Whatever the style, the point is blunt, reductive: Civilized humans can transform, in an instant, into blindingly destructive forces of nature. Not exactly an original thesis, but as a source of movie fodder, it's scarily entertaining.
fresh	There's plenty of visual inventiveness along the way, and moments that are both funny and twisted along with a healthy dose of violence for genre aficionados.
fresh	A clever collection of short films that coalesce around a central theme, wielding humor and horror in equal measure.
rotten	This is a crowd pleasing movie... Sad to say, I'm not in agreement with the crowd...
fresh	Damian Szifron spins a series of superior yarns, all of them unpredictable yet at the same time recognizably human. Any anthology film runs the risk of being judged by its weakest link, but there's not a single dud in the bunch.
fresh	If you've ever fantasized about busting up somebody's nuptials, this movie is for you.
fresh	Argentina's nominee for the foreign-film Oscar is a farce about revenge that is feral, ferocious and gut-bustingly funny. You'll laugh till it hurts.
fresh	Wild Tales aims to entertain and send its audience home with an artificial relief that will rub off on even the most cynical of human souls. Why resist it?
fresh	Film-making at its most friskily entertaining and surprising. Even if it doesn't win the Oscar on Sunday, it's a film to be prized for its audacious energy.
fresh	Feels as amazingly cohesive as it is relentlessly clever and entertaining.
fresh	In between its shocker start and equally startling windup, this Argentine anthology offers up a scabrous, often unsettlingly funny look at human behavior in extremis.
fresh	You never lose interest for a moment, and the images are often striking: Javier Julia did the stylish cinematography. Yet there's little lift from the carryings-on, not much buoyancy in the misanthropy.
fresh	The film is an anthology - a collection of six separate and unrelated stories - every one of which lives up to that title.
fresh	Well-acted, cleverly written and exquisitely crafted.
fresh	Six unrelated tales examine how dignity and propriety shut down in the face of anger, exasperation or the lure of a quick buck. All are funny because all feel true.
fresh	A collection of six vignettes all connected by themes of victimhood and vengeance, and spring-loaded with ironic twist endings worthy of O. Henry, the film feels like Pulp Fiction filtered through the baroque pop sensibility of Pedro Almodovar.
fresh	You're sorry when one episode ends; you can't wait for another to get to the gruesome point.
fresh	In its gaudy, predictable way, "Wild Tales" is enormous fun, and the consistent wit of the quiet stretches shows there's more to Szifron than shock tactics.
fresh	it's clear that Szifron is working from a deep well of imagination about how much people are willing to spite themselves in order to take down perceived enemies.
fresh	Six parables about revenge in the face of injustice, power, stupidity, and betrayal.
fresh	Wild Tales has so much feral, prickly energy that it gives off warmth rather than coldness.
rotten	Each of the segments involves violence and illustrates the arrogance of the wealthy and powerful, but their moralizing is as facile as the plotting is mechanical.
fresh	Each of the six vignettes that make up this unusually energetic anthology pertains to the methods of calculated mass dehumanization that are (barely) hidden beneath the practices of social institutions.
fresh	Each of the stories in Wild Tales could have been a full-length movie in itself, but each vignette is so exquisitely crafted, the sequence so carefully chosen, that the six fit flawlessly together.
fresh	Wild Tales is the very definition of a crowd-pleaser.
fresh	Szifron's voice is nonetheless very much his own, a mischievously blunt response to a culture of inescapable corruption, economic and social inequality and injustice.
fresh	Above all, note the ratio of laughter to mayhem, which remains high in Wild Tales despite the continually mounting pile of corpses.
fresh	A wickedly delightful compendium of six standalone shorts united by a theme of vengeance -- the kind that explodes in spectacular bursts after a put-upon soul is screwed over too many times.
fresh	Its tales of the unexpected have twists and turns, but they're always innovative, and the music choices are unexpectedly left-field and pulpishly entertaining.
fresh	Rather than being straight-up Tales from the Crypt grotesques, these vignettes are tinged with class consciousness and shadowed by the fallacy that revenge is empowering.
fresh	Easily the funniest satire of the year.
fresh	Like an act of revenge, Wild Tales probably isn't healthy or edifying, but damn, it feels good. Highly recommended.
rotten	Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron allows it to sit until it congeals in the dreary six-part anthology "Wild Tales."
fresh	Hilarious black comedy reminiscent of Warner Brothers cartoons at their most violent.
fresh	This dark comedy bears a resemblance to the likes of British sketch show The League of Gentleman, deranged, surreal and absolutely hilarious in parts.
fresh	An exemplary example of how to combine multiple stories in a coherent, complementary and often exhilarating manner.
fresh	Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that this phalanx of stories doesn't have a weak point.
fresh	Wild Tales gets off to an impressively electrifying start...
fresh	Each story unfolds concisely, establishing the characters and situation, building up the tensions and some laughter along the way. In such a short screen time, we barely know these characters but we relate to them.
fresh	Wild Tales is an insanely fun ride that marks Szifron as one to watch in the Argentinian cinema scene.
fresh	Ideally structured and often wickedly dark.
fresh	More than anything else, Wild Tales is to be recommended to the sheer fun of the experience.
fresh	An exciting and energizing achievement in film-making, a truly funny work that's equally deep and philosophical, all while not taking itself too seriously.
fresh	...it only cements Szifron's clear talent...
rotten	As in the episode with the engineer turned terrorist, where restitution of the family unit supersedes revolutionary politics, it's clear that Szifron lacks Almodovar's truly confrontational sensibility.
fresh	If you don't see a part of yourself in some of these stories, I suspect you are living in La Denegacion.
rotten	A viewer can be forgiven for violent eye-rolling.
fresh	The result is not the most explosive -- nor organic -- romance. Still, it swirls and settles in interesting ways.
fresh	[A] quiet, aching film ...
fresh	Giroux's refusal to pass judgment on his characters prevents us from doing so, and the film is much more powerful for it.
fresh	"Felix and Meira" appears to be a simple movie about fitting in, acceptance and sacrifice. Yet it's so elegant and poses many different sides that it's actually a very complex film with very complex characters.
fresh	It's always gratifying to see a movie in which an ostensibly closed-off community is depicted humanely rather than voyeuristically.
fresh	Luzer Twersky as Shulem, Meira's controlling husband, is a fine example of the film's willingness to extend empathy to all of its characters, and its refusal to pigeonhole them into a black and white moral landscape.
fresh	Giroux mistakes long, wordless scenes of characters gazing at each other for tenderness, but he imaginatively uses gospel music as the forbidden food of love ...
fresh	It may lack the heat of supposedly similar films about unlikely love, but that doesn't mean that it's short on romance. Felix and Meira's interactions are imbued with longing and desire that is impossible not be swept up in.
rotten	It tells a not-especially-interesting story about a not-especially-interesting couple from two different worlds that goes on and on before reaching its not-especially-interesting conclusion.
fresh	Felix and Meira makes fascinating observations on forbidden love and as well as on the Hasidic community. Although its pace is sometimes pokey, it's a movie offering nice rewards to the patient.
fresh	Director Maxime Giroux tells his tale in quiet, patient long takes that can be coolly serious at some times and disarmingly deadpan-funny at others.
fresh	This tenderly observed love story (by the director, Maxime Giroux) isn't about religion - or its lack - but about the attraction of difference and the undeniable need to feel alive.
rotten	What's missing here is the vitality and sense of release the couple's romance should bring. Felix and Meira continue to pine and mope; the movie mopes with them in exhausting, often awkwardly intrusive detail.
fresh	Felix & Meira eventually proves to have more in common with Fill The Void, and with Burshtein's effort to depict Orthodox Judaism as more than just a women's prison, than it had appeared.
fresh	A broadly moving portrait of the various roles that faith can play in a relationship.
rotten	Tender, heartfelt and exquisitely dull, the drama "Felix and Meira" illustrates the perils of trying to tell an emotional love story with meaningful stares and long pauses.
rotten	"Felix and Meira" is tender and sad, and wonderfully shot in snowy Quebec, but ultimately fails to connect. It's such a gentle whisper of a film, it's hard to hear what it wants to say.
fresh	Felix And Meira has the somber tone of a romance couched in painful sacrifice, but there's also sweetness and joy in Meira slowly emerging from her shell.
fresh	Giroux excels at implying his characters' internal processes.
fresh	Offers compassion over certainty, even when circumstances call for an all-or-nothing commitment to a happily ever after.
rotten	Maxime Giroux's sharp filmmaking instincts aren't always supported by similarly acute dramatic instincts.
fresh	Though set in present-day Montreal, this tender romance unfolds like an episode from another century, paying the sort of careful attention to social boundaries you'd expect to find in a classic forbidden-love novel.
fresh	Yaron is a luminous presence whose face is mesmerizing even if it isn't always readable.
fresh	In a strange way, Felix et Meira is so powerful precisely because it's so understated.
fresh	Fascinating tale of a secular Jew's attempt to get a Haredi wife to free herself from the confines of Orthodoxy.
rotten	A relentlessly bleak portrait of Stalinist Russia with camerawork that puts the viewer in the room with its characters.
rotten	Although it has some likeable characters, it's hard to stay focused with Child 44's uneven story. [Full Review In Spanish]
rotten	Child 44 feels contrived and you never get to empathize with the characters. [Full Review In Spanish]
rotten	...the film can often come across as disorienting and uneven.
rotten	CHILD 44 is a thriller with no thrills. It's too long, too dreary, and too overly serious.
rotten	In the end, the film lacks an imagination, and that unfortunately winds up dragging it through the mud.
fresh	Child 44 is not a bad crime-thriller, but it could have been way better, especially given the talent involved.
rotten	Overly complicated yet somehow anticlimactic, and constructed more with pat Hollywood pomp rather than the authentic grit it demands.
rotten	A hopeless muddle of clumsy police procedural, fraught domestic fireworks and heavy-handed totalitarian tropes, presented in the grimmest possible fashion and drawn out to insufferable length.
rotten	Forbidding and forgettable, this plodding adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's suspenseful thriller just doesn't translate onto the big screen.
fresh	I'm going against the current on Daniel Espinosa's Child 44 by simply not hating it, but I'll go further and say it's actually good -- with qualifications.
rotten	Child 44 arrives in cinemas with the kind of dull thud befitting a novel of door-stopper weightiness rather than a work endowed with soaring prose and considerable storytelling prowess.
rotten	Ambitious to a fault, this is a slightly serviceable story of murder that features strong performances, but little more than that.
rotten	An oppressively boring, unappealing and often incomprehensible misfire.
rotten	The movie hints at a riveting story but is incapable of delivering it.
rotten	Hardy is very odd, as usual.
rotten	The story is a confusing bore that leads achingly slowly to a solution as perfunctory as it is implausible.
rotten	The plotting gets a little sludgy...it runs out of ideas long before it plods to the final credits
fresh	Given these actors and the ravishing decrepitude of the locations and costumes and the lustrous cinematography of Oliver Wood, I found it more than watchable the whole way through.
rotten	Child 44 never knows what it wants to be: a mystery or an uninspired statement on dystopian governments.
rotten	If the Russian accents from this non-Russian cast weren't grating enough, the convoluted and seedy story of Child 44 would be reason enough to pass on this one despite the usually reliable presence of Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace.
rotten	Equally bloated and scatterbrained.
fresh	...a tense thriller set in Soviet Russia in 1953...tightly directed with surprisingly good pace...fine performances, especially by Hardy, Rapace, and Oldman...exceptional dark and forbidding cinematography enhanced by understated music.
rotten	What began as a novel by Tom Rob Smith probably should've stayed there, but for those with especially iron-like constitutions, "Child 44" does provide some terrific performances and a full sense of Soviet immersion.
rotten	A hopelessly muddled, po-faced and occasionally accidentally hilarious thriller set in Stalinist Russia.
rotten	Like The Interview, Child 44 will be remembered only for the controversy surrounding it.
rotten	Wouldn't know a "thrill" if it were plastered on a bottle of Stoli.
rotten	Child 44 doesn't just lose the plot. It loses the point.
fresh	"Child 44" is involving despite itself.
rotten	In such a bleak and distorted world, it is perverse to try to tell a whodunit story with conventional heroes and villains -- and yet that is what this misguided and contradictory film attempts.
fresh	Tom Hardy rolls his Russian accent around his mouth like its a shot of vodka to be savoured. With his Soviet-issue brutalist haircut and shambling bear's gait, plus the accent as thick as borscht, he inhabits completely the part of Leo Demidov.
rotten	The movie goes wildly off the rails chasing so many characters, subplots, and complications that you may find yourself zoning out.
fresh	Child 44 grows in stature and suspense as it gains focus, eventually revealing itself as a murky depiction of desperately unjust, fearful times.
fresh	Espinosa manages to engineer some standout moments and Hardy rises above his dodgy accent to deliver a cruelly believable portrait of a good man trapped between a hammer and sickle.
rotten	[An] unrelentingly grim, plodding, and close-to-incoherent adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's best-selling mystery.
rotten	It's as tedious as a bottomless bowl of borscht.
rotten	Nothing in "Child 44" adds up to much. The political backdrop and the period setting and all of those subplots and narrative tangents don't mean a lot when the film boils down to a typical fistfight/shoot out scenario we've seen countless times before.
rotten	Tom Hardy brings his robust, muscular presence to the role of Leo and he is watchable enough, but the forensic and psychological aspects are just dull; there is no fascination in the detection process.
rotten	Child 44 has strong actors, solid production values, and good intentions. But it mixes too many plot threads and ends up telling none of them particularly well.
rotten	What "Child 44" most resembles is a rushed and crowded pilot for a television drama.
rotten	The usual serial-killer thriller in Soviet drag.
rotten	Ultimately, what we have is a bloated, grim, underwhelming affair, which is unfortunate - because the movie starts out with a lot going for it.
rotten	Everyone overacts, leaning heavily on moments of unexpected shouting, with Hardy taking bottom honors.
rotten	A muddled, mumbling thriller that never gets us in an iron grip.
rotten	an exercise in empty histrionics.
fresh	For long stretches, it's dull and plodding, chugging along on the fumes of its earnest intentions. Still, there are worse ways to kill two hours than watching Hardy work his sturdy magic.
fresh	When it finally gets going, it becomes gloweringly compelling ...
rotten	Child 44 could have been far more compelling had it dug deeper into its political thriller layers and not drifted into yet another story of a diabolical killer on the loose.
rotten	A mediocre, generic production that does little to inspire.
fresh	Tom Hardy is characteristically compelling as Leo Demidov, a runaway orphan-turned-WW2 soldier transformed into a war hero by his role in the Battle of Berlin.
rotten	Just say nyet.
rotten	Despite gritty atmosphere and a sometimes smart script by the estimable Richard Price, whose credits include "The Wire," "Child 44" can't sort out the basics.
rotten	The film is at once devoted to corroborating and casting an exaggerated light on Soviet paranoia and the state's rhetoric of unmasking its enemies.
rotten	Overstuffed with plot, Child 44 becomes no more lucid as it progresses from one development to another.
rotten	It shouldn't be possible to make a movie this bad with a cast this good.
rotten	Gets lost in a meandering, overly-complicated narrative that often loses sight of the story it's trying to get across.
rotten	If 'Child 44' has any reason to exist it's so hungry Tom Hardy completists having something, anything else to chew on.
rotten	"Child 44" plays like a curious relic of an earlier Cold War mindset, when Western audiences took comfort that they were living on the right side of the Iron Curtain, and relied on movies to remind them as much.
rotten	A Soviet-era slog through crime and corruption, painted in grim shades of muck, blood, moss and bark, director Daniel Espinosa's "Child 44" turns a best-selling period-piece procedural into a slow, tedious thriller almost totally devoid of thrills.
rotten	The movie doesn't really captivate the way it should, and as the manhunt stretches on it actually diminishes in suspense, ultimately overstaying its two-plus-hour running time.
fresh	Offers a solid, serviceable adaptation of Tom Rob Arthur's bestselling novel, the first in a trilogy featuring the character of idealistic state security operative Leo Demidov.
rotten	Thanks to a feeble script, bland direction and - God, why? - those impenetrable accents, no one emerges from this fiasco with much dignity.
fresh	Hardy is immaculate as Leo, from accent to demeanour. Now on his fourth film with Hardy, Oldman is a pleasure to watch, and even the smallest of roles have been carefully cast ...
fresh	Hardy is excellent, his mix of strength and compassion giving genuine depth to a character who could simply have been a figurehead for the march of change.
fresh	Tom Hardy is excellent in the lead role and director Daniel Espinosa crafts some brilliant individual scenes but the story gets a little bogged down with a surfeit of subplots.
fresh	A haunting, funny, beautifully austere film about obsession, delusion and fantasy, all held together by the remarkable, and the remarkably still, performance by Rinko Kikuchi.
fresh	You can read this droll film as a fable, and that's probably better than as a picture of mental illness.
rotten	By the time that you get to an ending as frustratingly ambiguous as the beginning, it becomes clear that this road movie is more calling card than fully realised film.
rotten	Basically an interesting failure.
fresh	The flavor is odd and completely irresistible.
fresh	The interesting thing for me is the film's intermittent excursion from drama into bleak comedy
fresh	It's wonderful
fresh	The film's chief delight -- and it is, for the most part, quite delightful and quirky -- lies in these marginal characters.
fresh	A great film for people who are tired of associating the color black with sadness and despair: now, both of those things are available in snowy white!
fresh	Darkly humorous at times and deeply somber at others, Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter is an ambitious film that feels no need to over tell their chosen story.
fresh	This is a tale of delusion, illusion and confusion given life through a powerful performance by Rinko Kikuchi.
fresh	A fine and original movie that touches on a damaged lead character with grace. And, duh, Fargo fans should be especially intrigued.
fresh	I'm thankful real life is not governed by Coen Bros.' omniscience.
fresh	A melancholy ode to impossible dreams from the Austin, Texas-based filmmaking Zellner brothers.
rotten	File this one under "odd and interesting but ... "
fresh	The movie is lovely to look at. Its compositions make clever use of color and space, and Kumiko, in a crimson shawl on the snowy plains, is a striking figure.
fresh	If Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter takes its time, it's time worth taking.
fresh	In the title role, Kikuchi is impressive, easily handling Kumiko's comic and more somber sides and never allowing us to settle into a single or simple interpretation of the character.
fresh	If you're in the mood for something different, you're in luck: "Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter" takes elements of the traditional quest story into completely new places.
fresh	A haunting, fantasy adventure for the ages in one of this century's most breathtaking independent films.
fresh	Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter pretty much succeeds as a work of magical realism.
fresh	Little is explained, and even less is revealed about what makes Kumiko tick. But for the patient and inquisitive, the ride can be maddeningly absorbing, unearthing its own kind of treasure.
fresh	The Zellner Brothers' Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is as strange, surreal, and darkly funny as it is ultimately tragic.
fresh	Fans of obscure cinema will fall in love with this beautiful, cryptic, and outstanding treasure hunting pilgrimage. The more you think about Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter the more treasure you find buried within the film.
fresh	It's a strange movie, and perhaps not all that easy to love, but if the filmmakers had gone straight for "lovable," then they might have ruined the unique spell they have cast.
fresh	Surprising, mystical film about lonely woman on a mission.
fresh	An intriguing indie and certainly one-of-a-kind. The Coen Bros. likely would approve.
rotten	The simplicity of the setup works, so perhaps all of this layering -- of truth and legend and flights of fancy -- is an unnecessary burden here.
fresh	Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, a cool and ambitious slice of weird from Austin's own Zellner brothers, works best as pure fairy tale, a quest to find a fortune that the audiences knows doesn't actually exist.
fresh	As portraits of mental illness go, "Kumiko" is slender but even-handed, neither romanticizing its heroine's mania nor tipping into melodrama or horror.
fresh	"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter" is a supple combination of Little Red Riding Hood adventure, ironic road film and cross-cultural confusion.
fresh	...a beautiful, chilly odyssey.
fresh	A truly mystifying human puzzle.
fresh	An engaging, even surprising feature.
fresh	It's a beautiful and provocative film that will stick with you long after it's over.
rotten	The film's steady accumulation of little quirks - such as the fact that Kumiko has embroidered her treasure map on a piece of fabric, using a freeze-frame from "Fargo" as a template - soon grow tedious.
fresh	Despite its stasis, the feature is an original vision, best suited for those with high tolerance for art-house adventuring and an appreciation for the mischief the Coen Brothers conjured in their seminal 1996 hit, "Fargo."
fresh	With the gorgeously shot, sweetly paced Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter, David and Nathan Zellner make a strange, funny, sometimes alarmingly deadpan leap forward from their likable earlier features.
fresh	What should be a tragic story has so many upbeat turns that it charming and effective.
fresh	At her best, Kikuchi evokes the little match girl, bathing her bleak existence with too-brief warmth.
fresh	Though Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is a sad story, it keeps that sadness at bay with touches of whimsy as Kumiko sets out into the snowy wilderness to find the treasure she needs to be there.
fresh	An endearing unlikely heroine in an utterly charming escapade.
fresh	The filmmaking team of David and Nathan Zellner... have channeled Kumiko's visionary madness into a memorable, haunting and highly original American movie.
fresh	I can't say that this austere, beautiful movie satisfied my impatient desire for answers. (It seems, in fact, to be a rebuttal to that desire.) But I'll be thinking about Kumiko's journey for a long time.
rotten	Another vaporous Sundance hit...
rotten	The specifics of this movie are engaging, but the big picture stays buried.
fresh	Is the story, and its heroine's fate, a fairy tale or a delusion? If the former, the movie is as sweet as a Disney-inspired anime. If the latter, Kumiko is deeply sad.
fresh	Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is a moody comic allegory about desperation, disconnection and dreams that uses Fargo, the Coen brothers classic, as a touchstone to examine modern life.
fresh	Kikuchi brought humanity to the robots-vs.-monsters action of Pacific Rim in a small supporting role, and she ups that much more with the meek title character of Kumiko ...
fresh	Strange as it sounds - and is - Kumiko comprises a lingering display of empathy for its heroine, marching stridently on through her own peculiar headspace.
rotten	What I saw was a case of filmmakers blissed out on their own hermetic concept.
fresh	She's a loner with a singleminded, completely absurd mission... And the film goes along with her, right to the curious end.
fresh	Kumiko feels like a collection of amusing and/or depressing riffs stitched together within a context that barely matters.
fresh	Lyrical, memorable and beautifully conceived film about a woman charging after an elusive dream misfires in its final moments.
fresh	The title of the movie seems to promise adventure, and the movie does deliver that, though not in the conventional manner.
fresh	The beauty of Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter comes from the Zellners treating a silly, whimsical premise with utmost seriousness.
fresh	A delicate, haunting study of a woman who has in several senses lost her way.
fresh	...grounded by a moving performance by producer Rinko Kikuchi who is surrounded by a memorable cast of supporting players. This melancholy comedy will haunt you.
fresh	Beautifully acted, smartly written, skillfully directed, and gorgeously photographed
fresh	Kumiko only comes into its own when [she] arrives in Minnesota and must deal with locals as she heads up to Fargo despite knowing very little English.
rotten	A deranged pseudo-feminist fable, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter takes its tedious time getting to its unrewarding destination.
fresh	Stark, dark, bleak and funny. Just like "Fargo."
fresh	The Zellners may have their missteps as storytellers, but without question they're consummate image- and mood-makers.
fresh	The script posits sadness but can be uplifting and gives rise to various interpretations, ending in dream or warm fuzzy fulfillment of a vision.
fresh	It settles firmly into the perspective of a lost soul who finds solace in the swaddling security of fantasy.
fresh	The film, especially in its second half, after Kumiko lands at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, is resolutely more invested in, and sympathetic toward, its heroine than her fetish objects.
rotten	A monumental bore from start to finish.
fresh	Is Kumiko simply naive, or is she mentally ill? The film's perfect ending doesn't try to solve that riddle, but it will make you feel as if you've just seen something hypnotically original.
fresh	Living up to the expansiveness that its Sega Genesis-like title suggests, Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter's action possesses that rare ability to take on a radically different meaning as its narrative unfolds
fresh	With an airiness that recalls both Jarmusch and at-times the aforementioned Coens, Zellner tightrope-walks between whimsical and gravid.
fresh	It's hard to think of a film that ties itself so closely to another cinematic text while still retaining such an original tone.
fresh	This quietly magnificent piece should put the Zellners on the map: one day, the Coens will make movies inspired by them.
fresh	An unlikely mix of true-life tragedy and urban myth inspired this sweet, melancholy comedy ...
fresh	Weirdly funny and weirdly sad, one woman's slo-mo nervous breakdown becomes an exercise in pathos that is unforgettably poignant.
fresh	This is a quirky and deadpan comedy with an undertow of sadness that not even the occasional scene-stealing close-ups of Kumiko's pet rabbit eating noodles can alleviate.
rotten	There can hardly be a bigger waste of time than this piece of twee nonsense.
fresh	A road movie which transcends its ultra-quirky log-line.
fresh	This smart riff on the Coen brothers' 1996 classic Fargo is is a blend of wonderfully offbeat black comedy and much darker themes involving a central character who...
rotten	Too shallow and incurious to succeed as a character study, the film drifts aimlessly in a manner that frustrates and finally alienates.
fresh	It's a unique, funny and ultimately crushing descent into the deep well of loneliness, that cannily blurs the lines between fantasy and reality.
fresh	A fascinating - at times illuminating - tightrope act, but rarely an enjoyable one.
fresh	Rinko Kikuchi's superb core performance and some striking photography stand out in the latest feature from the Zellner Brothers.
rotten	There's little doubt that Kikuchi has put a lot of herself into the role of Kumiko, but the film doesn't probe very deep. The film upholds the annoying tradition of festival cinema of being an extended anecdote rather than a sustained story.
fresh	A little long and convoluted, but it has a good heart and an absurdist wit
fresh	Odd, mystical, strikingly original ...
fresh	A peculiar oddity that should appeal to those whose tastes favor the offbeat.
fresh	Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is a real find... an oddly funny and often heartbreaking portrait of mental illness as well as exploration of both the freeing power and danger of cinephilia.
fresh	Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter continues to create dissent in my mind; and that certainly makes it worthwhile.
fresh	Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is a wonderful little film that dares to dream, and dares you to dream with it.
fresh	There's a spooky poetry to the climactic sequences of Kumiko, as a one-of-a-kind individual disappears into the snow, in search of a memorable movie prop that also disappeared into the snow.
fresh	Its ambiguity should dazzle and delight; even in its darkest reading, Kumiko goes into the night softly, like a bunny rabbit retreating from the severity of the world.
fresh	It's the rare case of a story that's inspirational and devastating at once.
fresh	The film's great strength is in its eerie expressive visuals.
fresh	A delightfully mannered and eccentric delight.
fresh	Completely original, technically proficient, and simply mesmerizing.
fresh	Rinko Kikuchi is amazing as Kumiko.
fresh	Kumiko's unique vision makes for humour and pathos in David Zellner's film.
fresh	David Zellner co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Nathan, as two brothers pay homage to two other brothers who know how to make damn good movies - and yet this holds its own, in what is a more than worthy effort.
fresh	This movie could easily be cruelly humorous or embarrassingly overwrought, but walks the tonal tightrope over both.
fresh	One of the best films to ever premiere at Sundance.
fresh	A beguiling fable of buried treasure and movie-fed obsession.
fresh	A work of rigorously disciplined eccentricity, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is at once entirely accessible and yet appealing only to a rarified crowd ready to key into its narrow-bandwidth sense of humor.
fresh	An idiosyncratic, very personal portrait of an inspiring musical sensibility.
fresh	The great joy of the film, whether you know piano or not, is watching Bernstein teach.
fresh	Hawke's cinematic etude may not unlock all the mysteries of music, but "Seymour: An Introduction" is universal enough to be understood by a bananafish.
fresh	Like a touching master class on living correctly, listening to the charming Bernstein will have you changing keys.
fresh	Remarkably elegant film from Ethan Hawke about his friend, classical pianist and sometime-composer Seymour Bernstein, is one of early delights of 2015.
fresh	Expertly directed by Ethan Hawke, Seymour: An Introduction is both a portrait of an artist's life and a quiet repudiation of the assumptions that might tempt some people to call Bernstein a failure.
fresh	Octogenarian pianist Seymour Bernstein is the charming, inspirational subject of this appreciative, occasionally fawning documentary directed by the actor/novelist/filmmaker Ethan Hawke.
fresh	It's a nice movie, full of musicians talking of their love of the art form - you'll be enthralled, believe it or not, listening to a couple of guys talking about B flat.
fresh	Coming off of his superb one-two performances for Richard Linklater in Before Midnight and Boyhood, Hawke continues to work at a creative high level. He demonstrates a rapport and openness with his subject that proves exceptionally affecting.
fresh	Whether or not Hawke got any answers to his questions about the purpose of being artist, seeking them under the guidance of a teacher like Bernstein resulted in this work of art.
fresh	Seymour: An Introduction is just that - not too much biography, or history. And one needn't be a music aficionado, or a musician, to appreciate the modest erudition coming from this man.
fresh	By the end of our introduction, Bernstein emerges as a man who has found a way to build order out of life's chaos through music.
fresh	A tender counterpoint to Whiplash. Anyone in any field of artistic endeavor could learn something about their struggles from watching Bernstein's patience, and by listening to his arguments against the importance of fame
fresh	A quiet but charming conversation with a man who's lived what he loves.
fresh	Hawke chose well his subject; Bernstein is indeed an intriguing master and paragon of authenticity.
fresh	His playing is beautiful - he was a gifted concert pianist who gave up the stage at 50 to concentrate on teaching and composing. His stories are tremendous. And his voice, clear and strong, is magnetic.
fresh	"Seymour: An Introduction" gives viewers a soaring, sublime and enduringly meaningful glimpse of a man who is undoubtedly the real thing.
fresh	A positive, enjoyable and inspiring artist portrait.
fresh	This intimate look at the supremely mild-mannered piano virtuoso will find its audience.
fresh	It's hard to find much wrong with this film, itself a meditation on art and the practice of craft.
fresh	The director thinks we would enjoy meeting Bernstein ... Hawke is correct.
fresh	The movie's real subject is the difficulty -- and the critical importance -- of bringing into harmony one's personal and artistic lives, of being not only a good artist but a joyful one.
fresh	The result is a low-key but melodic production that is also clearly about Hawke's search for meaning in his artistic career. But that doesn't prevent the rest of us from enjoying Bernstein's sagacity.
fresh	Seymour: An Introduction is a delightful film experience about the transformative power of art.
fresh	A life's wisdom, distilled, conveyed with charm, wit and bracing precision in an understated yet lucid voice. Hawke's managed to capture the kindest, most no-bullshit guru you'd care to imagine.
fresh	Bernstein in action is a study of what a teacher should be: kind but with a steely resolve. He analyzes the music and figures how to overcome its obstacles.
fresh	A fondly made portrait ... of a gentle philosopher with a wicked wit, a superbly talented pianist who intellectually challenges and charms in equal parts.
fresh	Unusual, intelligent documentary whose subject is a pleasure to spend time with.
fresh	Hawke's first documentary is a perfect movie for a gray Sunday afternoon, a gentle and loving tribute to a man ... anachronistically convinced that talent is its own reward.
fresh	The sweetness of the subject's nature and the gentle modulations of his speaking voice are so potent that it would seem not just uncivil but futile to contradict him; yet Hawke is too alert and too inquiring to let the movie subside into worship.
fresh	The unfortunate disconnect between great artistry and great commercial success runs throughout history. But Bernstein is a special case because, unlike so many great musicians who fell unwillingly by the wayside, he chose his own path.
fresh	The movie kind of flits along-if one wanted to be cruel one would use a word like "dilettante"-pleasantly and informatively enough without ever lifting off.
fresh	More than a musical offering, it's a study in boundless passion, plus a wellspring of wisdom about art and life from a man who sees no dividing line between the one and the other.
fresh	Seymour: An Introduction is a loving and lovely tribute to a little-known American musician and mentor.
fresh	Hawke's gaze is too adoring, but the solitary sight of Bernstein putting together his foldout couch/bed in his one-room apartment is as poignant as his recital of the "Moonlight" Sonata.
fresh	Some very special aspects of New York City hide in plain sight. A case in point is Seymour Bernstein, the subject of actor Ethan Hawke's assured, meditative debut as a documentary director.
fresh	So effective does it close the distance between you and Mr. Bernstein that afterward you may find yourself scanning the streets, hoping to catch sight of him, as if for an old friend.
fresh	Sitting in on Bernstein's piano classes are where the doc shines.
fresh	This cinema study is a gentle tribute from one friend to the other.
fresh	For his debut as a documentary director, Ethan Hawke picked retired concert pianist Seymour Bernstein as a subject. He was a good choice.
fresh	"Seymour: An Introduction" is a compendium of tutorial anecdotes and poetic aphorisms he's collected over the years. Hawke's approach is apostolic, as if he's recording for posterity the sublime wisdom of a philosophical master.
fresh	Focusing on the quiet, assured Bernstein's unassuming but powerful presence, Hawke's film often plays like an attempt to share Bernstein's experience with the world.
fresh	Ethan Hawke's remarkable documentary puts us in close proximity to 80-something classical pianist Seymour Bernstein, whose funny, touching and vital presence is something you don't want to miss.
fresh	The film claims to be an introduction, but it's really a long series of conclusions.
fresh	Works both as a celebration of Bernstein, whose spirit is at once gentle and boldly generous, and as a way of exploring creativity and the meaning it can have in our lives.
fresh	Ethan Hawke's concentration on Seymour Bernstein isn't a betrayal of his own ego massaging, but rather an attempt to have a genuine soul-bearing conversation.
fresh	Seymour Bernstein's playing is technically marvelous, and in addition, his warm personality transfers to the music.
fresh	A predictably charming profile of little-known pianist Seymour Bernstein, but it really shines in its treatment of the musician's penchant for mysticism and in its expertly edited Schubert finale.
fresh	A cogent and exquisite documentary about Seymour Bernstein, a classical pianist who has spent the last 30 years of his life passing on his wisdom and counsel to his students.
fresh	A forgotten genius, Bernstein also proves an unsung raconteur.
fresh	Hawke's film is very well crafted, tightly edited and elegantly photographed. The acute musical selections only add to our appreciation of Seymour's selfless devotion to his art.
fresh	In his calm defense of beauty, craftsmanship, intellectual curiosity and emotional connection as vital human needs, this is one artist who knows he doesn't have to raise his voice to speak volumes.
rotten	... too earnest and cliched - with awkward English dialogue, considering the setting - and tends to oversimplify Afshin's true-life struggles.
rotten	By the time Desert Dancer heads for its shades-of-Argo climax, it's hard not to wish there had been a bit less melodrama, and a bit more desert dancing.
rotten	There would seem to be only one thing that the act of dancing cannot free the characters in Desert Dancer from, and that's the movie they're in.
rotten	Desert Dancer strays too frequently into melodrama to have much sticking power.
fresh	The characters are thin and the villains are one-note, but one gets worked up anyway, much as one gets played by a solid romance - or a dance movie.
rotten	The story of freedom from oppression and freedom of expression in Iran is a somber and ruthless one, but you'd never know the true extent of it by seeing this film.
fresh	In his feature film debut, director Richard Raymond keeps the story moving despite some dramatic cliches.
rotten	Director Richard Raymond, making his feature debut, doesn't seem to have enough story to fill out a full-length movie.
rotten	Its depiction of the internal tensions in Iranian politics and culture is not what you'd call super-nuanced, but it is sympathetic to Iran as an entity.
rotten	Unsurprisingly, dancing is the highlight of "Desert Dancer," but it hardly receives the attention it deserves.
rotten	As impressive as its dance sequences may be, Desert Dancer cannot overcome an intellectually lazy script that's as subtle as an eye-high leg kick.
rotten	Desert Dancer is the dramatization of a life story that rarely doesn't feel like a dramatization.
rotten	Reece Ritchie brings heart to the lead role, particularly in the decisive solo performance that caps the film. But that sequence is as expressive and alive as the rest of the supposedly movement-loving drama is static.
rotten	"Desert Dancer" explores fascinating aspects of present-day Iran but suffers mightily from simplistic and sentimental tendencies.
rotten	It's all over the place. All these are fine places to be when it comes to movies. It's just exhausting to try to be in all of them at once.
rotten	Raymond's diffuse direction is so old-school, made-for-cable-TV that it blunts the drama and never turns up the heat beyond tepid.
fresh	"Desert Dancer" does manage to movingly convey the chilling, ultimately triumphant experience of Ghaffarian's struggle for creative expression under a regime that tried to crush it.
rotten	With its overdrawn characters and hackneyed dialogue, it's a politicized "Billy Elliot."
rotten	Favors simple and tame to detailed and credible.
fresh	Desert Dancer is blessed by a powerful sincerity.
fresh	Movies about people trying to start dance companies tend to be as formulaic as sports movies, but "Desert Dancer" escapes the usual drawbacks - corniness and bad dancing - by the urgency of the context.
fresh	The interpretative dance is the most passionate thing in this true story of Iranian oppression
rotten	Reduces a politically-charged tale of artistic triumph in the face of oppression to a series of bland platitudes that wouldn't be out of place on an inspirational poster on the wall of a guidance counselor's office.
fresh	"Desert Dancer" is a conventional protest drama, but it offers many magic moments - especially when co-stars Freida Pinto and Reece Ritchie perform sinuous routines. Or simply gaze into each other's eyes.
rotten	Desert Dancer too often lapses into generic cinematic cliches, failing to live up to the dramatic potential of its subject matter.
rotten	Richard Raymond's feature debut never overcomes a sluggish solemnity, the film's political points dulled by performances from Freida Pinto and Reece Ritchie which overvalue glum earnestness.
rotten	As with so many "extraordinary" true stories, British director Richard Raymond's debut feature leaves you craving more truth and less canned inspirationalism.
rotten	The script by Jon Croker is a thin assemblage of cliches, with characterizations that are uniformly skin-deep.
fresh	A little gem that sparkles brightly as it celebrates not just dance but unshackled, uncensored creative expression.
fresh	A must-see biopic poignantly illustrating the indomitability of the human spirit, even in the most oppressive of circumstances.
fresh	The film plays too safe with its narrative. Fortunately, like its characters, it's most daring when it's in motion.
rotten	The film's relentless turning of its characters' experience into platitudes and homilies is served for our too-easy consumption.
fresh	... turns repetitive in spots and clearly is taking sides, but it assembles the abundant interviews and statistics into a compelling package.
rotten	There are times when a documentary seems so eager to keep you engaged and entertained that the filmmakers forget to stick to their ostensible subject.
fresh	It probably won't change many minds -- do these things ever? -- and it may not tell you much you don't know, but this is a solid and surprisingly effective activist documentary.
fresh	A chilling documentary showing how the cigarette, asbestos, fossil fuel and other industries manipulate scientific evidence.
fresh	The underlying tragedy of "Merchants of Doubt" is not that these flim-flam artists get away with their deceit, but that you and I continue to sit back and allow them their bully pulpits.
rotten	Both heavy-handed and smug, taking undue pride in saying very little that's insightful or new.
rotten	For a movie that spends a good amount of time exposing the bogus claims of the manufacturers of 'flame retardant' fabric, 'Merchants of Doubt' is not particularly incendiary.
fresh	A movie about manufactured consensus would be a vital public service. But "Merchants of Doubt" isn't quite that movie.
rotten	...largely preaches to the left-leaning choir with plenty of hissable sound bites and a generally glib tone that undercuts an otherwise understandable sense of righteous indignation.
fresh	The message here is convincingly clear: corporate America is involved in an elaborate and extravagantly funded game of three-card monty, playing the public for the suckers they are all-too willing to be.
fresh	Aside from an eye-opening investigation of useless and harmful flame repellents pumped into furniture, it sticks to climate change without broadening its scope to other examples of corporate spinning, which must be plentiful.
fresh	A compelling expose of professional propagandists, though the movie itself is not agenda-free.
fresh	Maybe it's meant to be a call to action, but it's a bit more like a social-issues documentary by Samuel Beckett. You laugh as you contemplate everyone's doom.
fresh	You leave "Merchants of Doubt," as you do any good muckraking documentary, both fascinated and enraged ...
fresh	Robert Kenner's documentary is an effective takedown of the ways that PR efforts to discredit science have shifted from helping protect Big Tobacco's profits to fueling the climate change denial movement.
fresh	Merchants of Doubt shouldn't be a hard sell. The fact that it is should make you very mad.
fresh	The people who need to see it probably won't, and it's hard not to come away from it feeling somewhat defeated.
fresh	Subtle, it's not. But it is effective.
fresh	Using images from sidewalk three-card Monte games, Kenner shows how often people can be suckered for their cash. His film demonstrates that professional cons are much, much bigger.
fresh	Should be seen by every American, especially those who question global climate change.
fresh	Damningly eviscerates most of the asinine arguments clung to by bought-and-paid-for representatives of the oil companies.
fresh	That money is the root of all evil is hardly news, but Kenner's documentary is more than just a plaint against corruption. He is, for one thing, a first-rate filmmaker.
fresh	Scarier than any horror movie.
fresh	Like the climate scientists it documents, Merchants of Doubt does a bang-up job of gathering and presenting facts, but it's missing that wow factor.
fresh	When "Merchants of Doubt" isn't making you mad, it makes you very simply, and overwhelmingly, sad.
fresh	When (and before) the end credits roll, you will probably feel a sense of outrage - and helplessness.
fresh	To quote one damning corporate memo seen in the film: "Doubt is our product."
fresh	Merchants is full of incredibly telling interactions and visuals to help make its case.
fresh	Smart, well-researched and shocking in its revelations.
fresh	The jury's back in on the PR hacks who sow confusion and manufacture ambiguity in the public debate over climate change: they're guilty of crimes against not only science and their fellow citizens but humanity itself.
fresh	strikes home the incredible power of corporations to institute change for their own aggrandizement.
fresh	Though not all the dots connect, there's plenty exposing the games corporations play, to make you believe the opposite of dangers they create. Including information gridlock, science actors, think tank mercenaries and well, the Red Scare and watermelons.
fresh	If two experts disagree, who do you trust? Bingo: spread doubt. Slick, stylish and deeply infuriating, Merchants of Doubt is splendid muckraking.
fresh	What Merchants of Doubt makes clearest is that these issues shouldn't be political.
fresh	The fact that some of these spinmeisters proudly base their method on the machinations of tobacco-industry lobbyists is doubly damning.
fresh	The subject of Merchants of Doubt is the catastrophe of global climate change, which is engulfing us even faster than predicted. Kenner doesn't waste time proving, in this terse, brilliantly argued movie, that climate change is happening.
fresh	The people who really need to see Kenner's movie will not. This is the portion of the American public that believes what it wants to believe, their blindness to scientific fact justified by the smooth operators seen on (shows like) Fox News.
fresh	On the whole, it has a great deal of important information presented in a lively way, and it has the power to get you riled up.
fresh	Kenner (unavoidably) breaks the climate change debate down into a political one--wrong versus right, right versus left.
fresh	This is a huge, unwieldy topic, and the filmmakers do an admirable job of condensing their information and making it comprehensible.
fresh	The filmmakers use the same techniques to influence you to buy into the theory that climate change is caused by actions of man as they claim those they criticize use to influence people to believe the idea that climate change caused by man is a hoax.
fresh	No matter what you think about tobacco, climate change, or fire retardants, this is an essential film because it addresses the key issue of trust.
rotten	The blatancy with which industries and lobbyists lie to the public...is enraging, of course, but Kenner's pretty much negated the point of his own work here.
fresh	[It] means to make people angry, and to make them think. It will surely do the former. I'd like to think it will do the latter.
fresh	This is an ugly film, though it has an upbeat spirit.
fresh	When your objective is to get nothing done, you have a serious advantage. If honesty isn't a priority, things get even easier. This is the most impactful -- and the most depressing -- takeaway of Robert Kenner's documentary.
fresh	A great primer on how corporate propaganda works now, in the age of 24-hour news channels addicted to "debate" when there is none and "controversy" where none exists.
fresh	Informative and infuriating ...
rotten	In this glossy informational mode of filmmaking, organization is everything, and director Robert Kenner (Food, Inc.) isn't much of a storyteller.
fresh	Tobacco companies have fallen far in recent years, but this zingy documentary explores how very high their p.r. machines set the bar for public misdirection.
fresh	Shows how a bunko artist is a bunko artist, whether on a corner or on CNN.
fresh	The film's spin toward a liberal audience means it chokes into ineffectuality when it tries to take a less ironic and more active stance on society's biggest current white whale.
rotten	The slickness of Kenner's presentation ironically distracts from the meat of his expose.
fresh	There are times when it feels as if the film's selected anecdotes are only scratching the surface of a greater evil, but what does make it to screen is intelligent, vital, and enraging.
rotten	Kenner has devoted himself to a revelation that isn't much of a revelation-that corporations obfuscate the full truth to protect their interests.
fresh	It understands the appeal of making strong points in attractive, engaging ways. It's taking lessons from the bad guys, but for the right side.
fresh	The shock, horror and occasional levity of the doc aside, Merchants of Doubt reminds us how maddening it is what money can do to ruin things.
fresh	An overly broad and somewhat random attack on a broad range of targets, but damning enough to make you mad
fresh	This material might be familiar to Frontline viewers and magazine readers, but Kenner's telling of the stories proves independently dramatic ...
fresh	An issues documentary that scores its points through a seductive combination of clearly stated arguments and pithy humor.
fresh	One of Kenner's main points is that the debate itself is being held on false grounds.
fresh	Robert Kenner's punchy documentary... claims that many of the libertarian nay-sayers rolled out on mainstream American television to spice up "scientific" debate have little knowledge of the subject. What matters, it seems, is how loudly you shout
fresh	Opens our eyes to the PR sleight of hand that huge corporations deploy to protect their profits when facts and science aren't going their way. Enraging.
fresh	Merchants of Doubt is a worthwhile, though depressing film.
fresh	It may sound like a standard-issue advocacy documentary concerned, as so many are, with the perils of global warming, but it's a lot more than that.
rotten	Like Michael Moore at his worst, it's hard to applaud a film when it's relentlessly poking fun at its opponents as if to pat itself, and its smug audience, heartily on the back
fresh	A hard-hitting documentary exposing how a small band of right-wing zealots in spreading disinformation on climate change.
fresh	The point-by-point Merchants of Doubt ... traces how companies shift the focus, reshape, and redirect discourse.
fresh	Illustrates how deniers have manipulated the scientific debate, and why the climate change scientists have succumbed to them.
fresh	There isn't a tremendous amount of new information in this generally well-crafted documentary. But it makes a potent, urgent case against the merchants of doubt who play games with the planet's future.
rotten	Merchants of Doubt's lack of independent opinion and poor probing of its skeptic subjects makes this doc rather inconsequential.
fresh	This is a movie so intrigued by its designated villains that it almost conveys a perverse form of admiration, and the fascination proves contagious.
rotten	By the film's own implicit admission, those who most need to see 'Merchants of Doubt' are also the least likely to be swayed by its argument.
rotten	It's difficult to comprehend quite why this stellar cast all signed up to this distinctively lacklustre project.
rotten	You have to admire a movie which takes a gold-star cast (Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges, Alicia Vikander) and creates such an unpolishable turd.
rotten	Seventh Son is derivative to its core.
rotten	Oscar-winners Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore deliver two of the hammiest performances of their distinguished careers in Sergei Bodrov's overcooked sword-and-sorcery fantasy.
rotten	It's a real problem when one of your leading characters sounds like a cross between Bane, the masked mutterer from The Dark Knight Rises, and a man competing in a hard-boiled-egg-eating contest.
rotten	What's missing is any sense of excitement.
rotten	Even if you're willing to go along for the ride, that still means taking Bridges' performance seriously. Which, believe me, isn't easy.
rotten	Boring, predictable and lacking inspiration, Seventh Son is bog-standard boilerplate fantasy and will probably reach the upper echelons of countless 'worst of' lists come the end of the year.
rotten	A muddled mish-mash.
rotten	It's lively and daft, and you find yourself wondering: all this expertise, and the best anybody could think to do with it was this?
rotten	Like Monty Python without the comedy, or at least without the intentional comedy. Jeff Bridges' saving throw against the Phoning It In curse fails!
rotten	Would it even have been improved if we could actually hear the dialogue? Probably not.
rotten	You leave the cinema wishing you'd understood even less of it than you did.
rotten	A film that plays like the most disposable Saturday-matinee fodder imaginable.
fresh	Enjoyable hokum.
rotten	The world's least impressive Big Lebowski reunion.
rotten	If this film were an apprentice it would have to serve several more years before being allowed master status.
rotten	Seventh Son is another one of those barely comprehensible 3D fantasy films with lots of dark Middle-earth-type settings and swirls of digital effects that make it hard to figure out precisely what is going on.
fresh	This is the first English language film of the twice Oscar-nominated Russian director Sergei Bodrov and he delivers an action-packed, enjoyable piece of escapism without too many boring detours.
fresh	It's far from the worst of this kind of movie, partly because there is so much talent, but it's hard to find that cheering. To say it could be worse is faint praise.
rotten	Seventh Son often feels like the kind of film that would work better with even less plot... if they'd simply outlined the story as "we got to stop that witch" and then just rattled through the action sequences as quickly as possible.
fresh	Seventh Son has all the requisite parts: witch hunters, witches, a naive apprentice, dragons, simple townsfolk and, err, guys with axes for arms.
fresh	Bridges comes along and gives exactly the right perversity to make things fun in a dippy, loopy way, and so the aggregate effect of Seventh Son is not, in fact, boredom.
rotten	"Seventh Son" moves at a fairly quick pace and has a sense of humor about itself. That doesn't mean it's thrilling, or funny. Just that it's a quickly forgotten pile of junk.
rotten	'Seventh Son' suffers from fatal Hobbit-osis.
fresh	Judging from his Rooster Cogburn enunciation, Jeff Bridges may literally be chewing the Dante Ferretti-designed scenery in this utterly unnecessary but diverting and attractive fantasy adventure.
rotten	Wizards, witches and dragons. So what else is new?
rotten	Seventh Son is a very bad film, to be sure, but I'd like to think its badness would have been as evident had it been whisked at once to the frontlines of Universal's summer slate, emboldened by the confidence of a proper blockbuster premiere.
rotten	It's a loud, joyless mess.
rotten	The twisty, everything-and-the-kitchen-witch narrative is, by turns, exciting and deadly dull.
rotten	This close. You were this close, Sergei Bodrov, this close to finding the right ratio of badness to goodness -- this close to churning out a ham and cheese sandwich to rival the likes of Beastmaster, Willow and Hawk the Slayer.
rotten	Every soulless soul is a well-worn archetype; every monster, even in 3D, is an anemic reiteration of a witless behemoth that couldn't scare the bejesus out of your virgin Aunt Tilly.
rotten	The most notable thing about it is that even with the amazing aggregation of asininity crammed into its running time, it still manages be a thudding bore.
rotten	"Seventh Son" wastes a promising cast with unfocused and incoherent story decisions, unusual-but-not-in-a-good-way acting, unfortunate choices with gender roles and one-sided depiction of people with color.
rotten	Jeff Bridges gives his otherwise bland character a unique accent (speech impediment?), delivering all of his lines as a mix of his True Grit character, a belligerent walrus, and a 45 rpm record played at 33-1/3 rpm.
rotten	Moore vamps and camps it up, seemingly aware that the only way to liven up the dreadful material is by trying to out-wicked the Wicked Witch of the West.
rotten	Impressive set design and visuals, excessive CGI, and a loud score from Marco Beltrami can't fully compensate for bland character development and a predictable narrative that rushes along on a linear trajectory.
rotten	... incoherent fantasy adventure filled with swordplay, sorcery and supernatural nonsense.
rotten	On the plus side, by making a movie this bad, studios are finally (and inadvertently) caving in to growing audience demand for fewer sequels and remakes.
rotten	Seventh Son would be utterly forgettable, were it not for some decent directorial elements and the performances of Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore.
rotten	Everyone involved needs to sit quietly and think about what they've done.
rotten	A strange movie that manages to be both ridiculous and bland, its chief point of interest is the spectacle of a great actor caught in career decline.
rotten	Seventh Son doesn't break much new ground, but it's a reasonably entertaining walk through familiar, friendly territory. Every once in a while, that's okay too.
rotten	Projecting noise and spectacle without any emotional investment or thematic undercurrents, "Seventh Son" winds up being a monstrous dud.
rotten	Sometimes you get halfway through a movie and you can't believe that what you're seeing made its way from Los Angeles or someone's Los Angeles computer to where you're sitting.
rotten	With an estimated budget of $70-100 million, the only way this dog will make a profit is to reap as much as possible out of the opening weekend, before people can spread the word, and get out of town fast.
rotten	Weak YA adaptation is far more mature than the books.
rotten	Nothing in this film is fully developed, which explains the script problems.
fresh	The battle scenes are mercifully short --- thank you to director Sergey Bodrov --- which results in a brisk outing at an hour and forty-two minutes.
fresh	No masterpiece, but a welcome February surprise with a lively cast and rugged action.
rotten	Not a cinematic abomination but clearly nothing good let alone great. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Another dead of winter bomb, a trifecta for Bridges.
rotten	It's a waste of talent for all those involved.
fresh	One doesn't want to damn the movie with faint praise by saying "it's not that bad," but that's kind of the most objectively accurate description of it, in all honesty.
rotten	Right out of the gate it feels years past its expiration date.
fresh	Obviously, this is not a particularly serious movie -- there's one scene of happy villagers leading a witch off to execution that feels remarkably like a "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" outtake -- but neither is it sloppy.
rotten	"Seventh Son" delivers exactly what it promises: Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore slumming in a laughably generic sword-and-sorcery almost-epic.
rotten	Even in 3-D and shot in the mountains of British Columbia, the film is a flat experience, with an incongruity between its big-budget ambitions and ho-hum impact.
rotten	Even on paper, the latest February throwaway, "Seventh Son," sounds like a bad idea ...
rotten	Seventh Son may try to harness alchemy and witchcraft, but sadly, there's no magic here.
rotten	Perhaps it's not so much a matter that Bridges is out of place in the material as it is that the material and the rest of the cast have no idea how to keep up with him.
rotten	It's not as bad as you might fear but it's definitely not as good as you would hope.
rotten	The movie's imagination runs riot in the scenery, sets, and costumes in what is an otherwise routine centuries-long feud between good and evil with paper-thin motivations.
rotten	Checks off the boxes of Swords-and-Sorcery Moviemaking 101 without bothering to dig deeper or come up with a new or imaginative angle to explore.
fresh	The fight scenes are exciting, the visuals and special effects are impressive, and it is fun to see two big actors take on these scenery-chomping roles.
rotten	There's a fine line between charm and cheese in fantasy epics, and movies as silly and overwrought as Seventh Son only help to illustrate just how hard it is to hit the right tone.
rotten	The dialogue in Seventh Son is dismal. The plotting is awkward. Nothing much works as storytelling. But even those problems are overshadowed by the accents -- the source of much of the hilarity.
rotten	If you want guaranteed sleep, see "The Seventh Son."
rotten	A strong contender for worst movie of 2015.
rotten	I know it's early, but "Seventh Son" may actually be the worst movie of the year. It will most certainly be a contender.
rotten	Seventh Son is brisk and unpretentious, though the fact that these two qualities can be considered remarkable probably says more about the state of modern genre filmmaking than it does about the movie itself.
rotten	At least Moore has not played a character like Malkin in recent memory. The same cannot be said for Bridges, whose flawed, alcoholic hero shtick is starting to wear thin.
rotten	The surprise is that by genre standards [Seventh Son isn't] that bad-it's just that everything in it has been done before.
rotten	Jeff Bridges's abysmally campy performance may be the worst thing about disposable sword-and-sorcery fantasy Seventh Son, but it's also the only memorable thing.
rotten	Once the plot dominoes are arranged in an overlong series of setups, Seventh Son ends up being a movie about walking, interrupted occasionally by a battle against a mythological monster.
rotten	Seventh Son is thoroughly ill-conceived, a pale imitation of its more adventurous and breathtaking brethren.
rotten	Harmless enough, and some of you looking for a flashy blockbuster full of mythological monsters and witches powered by CGI will find this passable for entertainment.
rotten	"Seventh Son" tells a story of dragons, witches, ghosts and ogres, but the most fantastic thing about it is the idea that someone thought this lumpy, bumpy and swollen sack of tired tropes and cluttered CGI would attract audiences.
rotten	I'll say this for Seventh Son: it wanted to be over as badly as I wanted it to end.
rotten	This 'Son' is stillborn.
rotten	Mythology 101, an author taking old school truisms and introducing them to a demo that probably won't know what a "tome" is unless it's spelled out specifically for them on their Kindle
rotten	At this point, it's tempting to wonder if Jeff Bridges accepts roles chiefly on the basis of whether or not he'll get to sport grizzly facial hair and talk funny.
fresh	Nothing here is particularly fresh, but watching it is like seeing a slice of familiar art reworked with a colorful new swatch of Crayolas. Deep? No. Thoughtful? No. A thigh-slapping good time? Oh, yes.
rotten	Though the film sat in drydock for a year, partly so technicians could convert it to 3-D, it looks as dull as it sounds.
rotten	Bodrov's ability to put this junky material through the paces can only cloak its inadequacies for so long-right up to the point where Seventh Son teases a sequel.
rotten	The story is so familiar that even if you haven't read Joseph Delaney's "The Spook's Apprentice" you're never surprised by what happens.
rotten	A movie that's hard to believe anyone was passionate enough about to write/make/finish.
rotten	You'd think Julianne Moore leading a coven of witches who can transform into dragons, bears and Djimon Hounsou would be more entertaining.
rotten	[Bridges] is so at odds with the film's tone in every other way that it's either an intentional middle finger to the original story, or a Captain Jack Sparrow gamble that completely failed.
rotten	The Hobbit and 'Game of Thrones' both have done this form of the fantasy genre much better in recent years.
fresh	Let me put it this way: if you loved Krull, you will at least 'like' Seventh Son.
rotten	It is likely to be one of the worst films of the year, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. Yes, Seventh Son is that kind of movie.
rotten	I was disappointed that there were no fire-breathing mummy ninjas from space, but you have to save something for the sequel.
rotten	The word "fantasy" is synonymous with "imagination," the very thing Seventh Son lacks.
rotten	Why does this movie exist? And what the hell are A-list actors like Moore and Bridges doing in something that seems so clearly destined to perplex insomniac Starz viewers several weeks from now?
rotten	[Jeff Bridges] sounds like Rooster Cogburn filtered through his sing-songy psycho from the dreadful remake of 'The Vanishing.'
rotten	For a film featuring witches, dragons, shape-shifters, cleavage and Jeff Bridges, Seventh Son sure isn't much fun.
rotten	Seventh Son is a fantastical adventure we've seen time and time again, filled with animated monsters, vapid characters and a female villain that barely rises above being a crazy ex-girlfriend.
rotten	Is it bad enough to cost Julianne Moore her Oscar?
rotten	While never boring, "Seventh Son" is shellacked with excess, emerging as a particularly noisy extravaganza, not an imaginative one.
rotten	The stars shine, but the special effects are strictly fantasy-film assembly line, with hardly a spark of inspiration.
rotten	As is often the case in films like this, Seventh Son is at its weakest when it tries to leaven its brink-of-disaster gravity with a little nerdy humor.
rotten	Son of a dud.
rotten	An over-designed, under-conceived fantasy epic in which even topnotch contributors can't get the chemistry right, leaving Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore looking silly.
fresh	Cleverly acted by a cast that truly believes in the material
fresh	Breezy New York affair lets everyone be likeable
fresh	The strong cast, a beautiful score, and a surprisingly affecting ending make it more convincing that it seems at first.
fresh	Not the luckiest pair of lovers, or the most fortunate use of two hours of anybody's time.
fresh	As silly as "5 to 7" is, there's a great deal of truth lapping at the corners concerning the long-range value of a broken heart, an occupational hazard of love that has inspired writers to pen some of time's greatest novels.
fresh	It's not a masterpiece, but it is a pleasant surprise for the genre.
rotten	"5 to 7" is all over the map in terms of tonality and screenwriting, with Levin trying to stuff his favorite elements from French cinema into a movie that can't handle the weight.
fresh	Though Yelchin does not elevate his role much above pasty callowness, Marlohe brings to hers a luminous irony and melancholy that makes her the ideal elusive beauty of hyper-romantic adolescent dreams.
fresh	The problem with 5 to 7 is that the most important romance, between Brian and Arielle, never feels real.
fresh	One of the best date-night movies of the season without a doubt.
fresh	there is a likable quality to "5 to 7" that had me charmed from start to finish
rotten	There aren't many surprises in "5 to 7," unless you count such startlingly cliched bits of dialogue as "Life is a collection of moments" and "There's no free lunch."
fresh	"5 to 7" is a modern-day fairy tale - albeit one with a bittersweet ending.
rotten	The Brian-and-Arielle story never quite feels believable; it plays more like a novel than a genuine love story, like a work in progress, rather than a beginning and, inevitably, an end.
fresh	...like a marriage between American screwball romantic comedies and the French New Wave
fresh	Levin is a good enough writer that true feelings come through among the words, and, for the most part, this movie is a fine achievement.
rotten	Levin, in an effort to appease an American sensibility, has taken sophisticated subject matter and made a movie for children.
rotten	For an R-rated romance about a young writer's affair with a sultry French siren, "5 to 7" generates all the heat of an Easy-Bake Oven. It aims to sizzle but quickly fizzles.
rotten	Watching Levin's movie is the equivalent of reading a collection of pre-workshopped, college-level short stories, each scene or bit of dialogue in as desperate need of vision and individual style as the last.
fresh	It expresses a belief in love as something miraculous and transformational. It says that love makes people what they are and provides the experiences that reverberate for a lifetime.
rotten	...a bland salute wrapped within a tepid plot that also owes itself to Mike Nichols' The Graduate.
fresh	A drama about the joys and challenges of an unconventional affair.
rotten	Somewhere before the halfway point the movie crosses a line, and its fantasy version of New York, not to mention of French women, gets to looking kind of hoary and inadvertently adolescent.
fresh	Alluring performances from Yelchin, Marlohe, and the supporting cast ... nimbly carry the film from start to finish.
fresh	"5 to 7" is an interesting directing debut that, like Brian, shows promise.
fresh	Although Mr. Levin tends to embrace cliches and overstatement ... he can also surprise you with delicate touches, a pained look, a wince of recognition.
rotten	It's as much a triumph of boyish wish fulfillment as Peter Parker swinging on skyscrapers.
rotten	While the film has an undeniably sexy glow, it's too earnest and sappy by half.
rotten	There must have been pretty slim pickings at the Neil Simon store by the time "5 to 7" writer-director Victor Levin got there.
rotten	Its central relationship has a sitcom-ish superficiality, heavy on light banter and lacking in any real passion.
fresh	Even if 5 to 7 sometimes feels like a romantic fantasy, it's grounded in compromises-haunting romanticism colliding with the imperfect way things actually are.
fresh	Nothing turns out the way you expect it. Everyone has an F.A.O. Schwarz gift box full of surprises before 5 to 7 smoothly sails into its final sunset over the Manhattan skyline, and so will you.
fresh	Levin's rendering of a literary and ever-surprising New York touches Woody Allen levels, even as he slyly shifts the tone from near-farcical to elegiac, with references to Truffaut's "Jules and Jim."
fresh	It has a bright, literate charm that's hard to resist, thanks to the scattered witticisms in Levin's script, a deftly managed tone, and fine performances across the cast.
fresh	It's the type of thing only [a film] with an accent can get away with.
rotten	Though it's understandable that the melancholy Arielle is moved by Brian's passion for her, the contrasts between them always makes her seem like more of a babysitter than a paramour.
fresh	5 to 7 is the Before Sunrise of infidelity.
fresh	A lush cross-cultural romance all set against the dreamy backdrop of Manhattan, writer/director Victor Lewin's rather old-fashioned but generously witty film ticks all of the right boxes when it comes to its literary tale of an unlikely romance.
rotten	At the end of the film one wonders exactly what 5 to 7 is and how it happened.
fresh	For all of its artificial plotting and cliched dialogue, "5 to 7" has its charms.
fresh	Ironically, the Victor Levin film's mildness turns out to be its most engaging quality.
fresh	Sumptuous and romantic in an attractively old-fashioned way despite a hitch designed to give some contemporary American idealists pause... the film satisfies in a wholly commercial way.
fresh	Courageously sentimental in an age of irony, Victor Levin's refreshingly articulate "5 to 7" delivers romance of the sort thought lost since the days of Audrey Hepburn, for those who appreciate such finery.
fresh	Too cloying to be anything more than a dalliance.
rotten	Much more of an adolescent male fantasy than a relatable, genuine film about love or relationships, 5 To 7 is deeply naive and has very few, if any real insights to the heart or human condition.
fresh	5 To 7 isn't a perfect film, but it does a remarkable job of engaging the audience with just enough charm to distract from its wholly unoriginal story.
rotten	Genre aficionados will best appreciate this latest Hong Kong martial-arts adventure.
fresh	Teddy Chen's combination police procedural and kick-ass action film provides a sturdy vehicle for longtime Hong Kong star Donnie Yen, who at age 51 proves he's still in good enough shape to deliver all the right moves.
rotten	Kung Fu Jungle/Killer is a factory-made cheeseburger...
rotten	Kung Fu Killer is all brawn and no brains, making for a furiously frenzied action watch without an ounce of interest outside of punches and kicks.
rotten	"Kung Fu Killer" lacks the brio and spice of its ancestors.
fresh	Kung Fu Killer manages to be your better-than-average chop-socky fun for a couple of reasons, starting with veteran actor Donnie Yen in the lead as Mo Hahou, who can fight and emote with equal proficiency.
fresh	The versatility of Kung Fu Killer intrigues while the bone crunching action thoroughly satisfies on every level. Kung Fu Killer is a sensational thriller with ferocious action and features Donnie Yen at his absolute best.
fresh	Director Teddy Chan knows his way around a brutal fight scene for sure, and he makes it clear from even the film's first moments that his return to directing after five years will be totally in thrall to the filmmaking dynasties that raised him.
fresh	This isn't a new golden age of martial arts films, but with Yen holding down the fort in China and southeast Asian fighters Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, it's a pretty good one.
fresh	Here, in this entertaining, preposterous goof of a kung fu movie, are all those values missing from the mainstream of American action filmmaking ...
rotten	An undeniably bland film in style and story, despite a few elaborately staged fight sequences.
fresh	Yen, along with director Teddy Chan, have been taking a few cues from The Raid and the new breed of action flick.
fresh	[An] efficient thriller that's sure to tick all the boxes for fans of Asian action movies.
fresh	The fight scenes are terrific, but the haphazard plotting, off-the-peg characterisations and drippy music elsewhere lack flavour.
fresh	Some of the fight scenes are dazzling in their speed and complexity.
fresh	There are plenty of shootouts and punch-ups but the film's most entertaining sequences revolve around Jim using his head as opposed to his fists.
rotten	Heavy on the gunfire and light on believability, "The Gunman" is a nice looking yet unsatisfying film barely kept afloat by its star
rotten	Trite, clumsily assembled spyboiler more closely resembles an accident scene.
rotten	Too violent to be taken seriously and too serious to be any fun.
fresh	There are a lot of actors you expect to see headlining action films. Sean Penn is not one of them. Yet here he is proving beyond any sensible question that he can roll, run shoot, stab and bleed with the best of them.
rotten	Part of the problem is the script's determination to drag some of Spain's most scenic spots into the action whether or not they suit the mood.
rotten	There is a baseline of filmmaking competence to The Gunman that rescues it from the gutter, but despite its star power it doesn't have a strong enough script or charismatic enough lead to carry it over the line into entertainment.
fresh	Really, it's all about engaging in that ancient action movie pleasure of watching a well-trained killer fight for his life and save his woman.
fresh	If you want a thriller about architecture, here is your thing. Gaudi with Guns, they could have called it.
fresh	...a thoughtful, provocative thriller replete with richly crafted characters, gripping set pieces, and an underlying moral drive about the very nature and consequences of violence.
fresh	Action packed, with tense and thrilling sequences, although things come together in the end, I was frustrated by the constantly shifting nature of the story
rotten	Ultimately too absurd to take seriously and too serious to enjoy as a popcorn flick. If its target is being surprisingly dull, it's a bullseye.
rotten	An almost astonishing dull and misguided thriller...
fresh	Now that Liam Neeson's stint as an AARP action hero seems to have Run All Night into the ground, you won't believe who's buff, sweaty and ready to take over.
fresh	In his latest film, The Gunman, Morel tones down the action in favor of a more thoughtful and mature exploration of violence and its consequences. It also reinforces that Sean Penn still has the best scream/cry in the business.
rotten	Action at its most tedious.
rotten	Rarely, though, have two Academy Award-winning actors been so stunningly off the mark in the same movie.
rotten	It's just another tourist salad bar of stale, limp man-on-the-run cliches with chases, hand-to-hand-combat, gunfire, and an hilariously pretentious sequence set during a bullfight.
rotten	Laughably sanctimonious for a Taken retread about a murderer who's too sexy for his shirt.
rotten	"The Gunman" is depressingly bad, thanks to its plotting and world-weary cast. They all look overheated and worn out.
rotten	I object to The Gunman because it's unconvincing and incoherent.
rotten	It's a gritty, generic 'guy' thing from the get-go.
rotten	An ill fit for Sean Penn on any front - too tight to let his action-hero experimentation breathe and too loose for his geopolitical ire to take hold. In the areas of art and altruism, it plays like something Penn probably loathes: voluntourism.
rotten	Penn shows off his muscles as well as his social conscience (shirtless, his forearms look as brawny as Popeye's), but with Taken director Morel at the helm it's hardly surprising that the action sequences should be more persuasive than the soul searching.
rotten	A novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette provides the source material, but the only real "auteur" here is Morel, for whom this is very much more of the same.
rotten	... some decent shootouts and hand-to-hand combat but the writing mostly stinks, allowing for gaping narrative holes and more improv rants by Bardem ... Penn seems less enigmatic than just plain bored.
rotten	Anti-American Sniper. In the murky midst of multiple mercenaries, a two-timing damsel in distress, corporate conmen, a differently duplicitous Javier Bardem checking in, macho mayhem and matadors. And in any case, an anti-hero somewhat saved by the bull.
fresh	It's Rambo tailored to Penn's humanitarian interests.
rotten	The Gunman feels like Sean Penn's belated audition for The Expendables franchise. The audience would have collectively hurled in unison if Penn showed off his shirtless, compact, overly beefy physique one more time.
rotten	By attempting to parachute in weighty geopolitical themes to a successful action formula, the film sinks, leaving little to savour.
rotten	A dull, generic retread, made far worse by Penn's self-seriousness as an actor, by the banal political pieties he's grafted on as producer and co-writer, and by the presence of a pitifully retrograde female lead role.
rotten	Sean Penn, an actor you can't take your eyes off when he's on screen , is not the problem with The Gunman. Neither is its terrific , if underused , cast. This attempt to turn Penn into a late-blooming action star is just too convoluted.
fresh	I enjoyed this more than I expected I would, mainly because of the cast and because I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was not just a derivative Taken knock-off.
rotten	"The Gunman" does not hold up well to scrutiny as it rehashes subjects done better in other films, including Morel's first two features.
rotten	By the time we get to the laughable climax the film has lost any pulse it had, and "The Gunman" ends up being a major let-down.
rotten	It misleads audiences hoping for a girtty action thriller and ends up being a huge disappointment.
rotten	The Gunman simply doesn't work as either escapist entertainment or a serious political thriller; it may very well fire a thousand shots in its pursuit of action and excitement, but very few -- if any of them -- go the distance to the finale.
rotten	Penn...is at least trying to say something about relief work in third world countries, but the film slips so quickly into generic thriller mode it feels like it mutated in post-production.
rotten	Those hoping for the next Taken will be disappointed by the slow-burn character piece that is The Gunman.
rotten	"The Gunman," as fashioned by Penn and his collaborators, is an ugly, morally nebulous thriller that attempts to offer edification even as it panders to the lowest common denominator.
rotten	The Gunman is among the surliest of its kind, an elder actioner of unrelenting violence and preachy geopolitical ardor. Sean Penn looks tired, and this movie grows more and more tiresome with every kill.
rotten	... A muddled, confusing mess built around a disinterested Penn, who seems to have decided his work was done when he left the weight room.
rotten	I doubt The Gunman will do much to advance Penn's foray into action-hero bankability, and that's probably a good thing. He's too fine an actor to be mired in nonstop shootouts while flashing his pecs and looking scowly.
rotten	Playing an assassin trying to atone for his past sins, Penn (who also gets a screenwriter credit alongside Pete Travis) strains to layer this standard thriller with social conscience.
rotten	This isn't so much a film in which every ageing male fantasist can invest as a film that works as an allegory for the state of Penn's career alone. A specialised taste, I suspect.
rotten	While it's an admirable attempt at a more grown-up type of entertainment, the movie winds up feeling rather leaden.
rotten	A dark European thriller like "The Gunman" usually requires a star who exudes cool detachment, not a firebrand like Sean Penn, who gamely proceeds in spite of the obvious miscasting.
rotten	...serious overacting by Penn...filled with hackneyed scenes...Winstone's accent so deep subtitles are needed...a nonsensical story.
rotten	From the opening scene through to the very last frame, "The Gunman" is completely predictable, and a brutally violent, gory mess. Despite its insane savagery, the beginning and end of "The Gunman" are downright laughable.
rotten	While director Pierre Morel manages to build tension in parts of "The Gunman", it's pretty hollow considering we don't care much for Jim Terrier, Penn's character.
rotten	If the film had been more of a slow-burn, centered on mystery and intrigue, with bursts of hard-R action, all concerned might have really had something here. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Gunman degenerates into dreary setups for guns and gore. Penn merits more. So do we.
rotten	Sean Penn tries to better Liam Neeson in the middle-aged ass-kicker action film genre, and fails miserably.
rotten	Penn wanted to his own action franchise, but the production forgot all the basics, leaving the end result weirdly impotent.
fresh	Apparently, if you're a veteran Hollywood actor, you get your AARP card at 50 and your action movie franchise at 55.
fresh	The actors are good and the action is thrilling. And if the film isn't quite as seriously political as I'm guessing Penn told himself it was, it's definitely an offbeat change of pace for us.
rotten	Like a queasy blend of Still Alice and The Bourne Identity.
rotten	The film's real fault is its 'hero', a glum, sour-faced sociopath who it's almost impossible to root for.
rotten	Obviousness prevails.
rotten	The kind of throughly anonymous and undistinguished film that barely would have passed muster as a mid-2000s DTV project top-lining a third-tier TV star.
rotten	It devolves into a mess of worn plot lines. If Morel wanted to give Penn's career new life as a world-weary action hero, he missed his target.
rotten	Nothing but a standard-issue series of action tropes that grow more and more ludicrous as each tries to top the last.
rotten	Stars too often produce the kind of movie they want to star in, instead of the kind of movie anyone wants to watch.
rotten	With this effort, Penn is way off the mark.
rotten	The Gunman is a wild misfire.
rotten	Part of the contract that movies of this sort forge with moviegoers is that the reasons for all the running and gunning won't get in the way of the action. "The Gunman" doesn't play by those rules.
rotten	Penn is dour and not the least bit heroic in this movie. He survives the action sequences but neither they nor his participation in them gets the blood pumping.
rotten	Penn's gym-bunny loveliness is the most attractively toned part of the film. Everything else is out of condition.
rotten	Sean Penn has spent a lot of time in the gym lately. We know this because, well, it's hard to ignore when a 54-year-old man grimly grabs every opportunity to shed his shirt.
rotten	The Gunman is a pretty dumb movie in smart package.
rotten	The movie's veiled indictment of multinational corporate interests that generate unrest in Third World nations for their own financial gain also falls somewhat flat, taking a back seat to the shoot-'em-up histrionics.
rotten	While it has its fair share of white-knuckle moments, The Gunman gets bogged down by uneven storytelling and a mostly wasted cast.
rotten	A plot that makes no sense, characters that are barely there, and a denouement that is an insult to everybody's intelligence, all combine to make Penn's action-man debut fire blanks.
rotten	Too portentous to work as an action-hero romp, and far too sweaty and derivative to have any kind of political or satirical kick, the movie misses almost every target at which it aims.
rotten	If the film's intent is to condition the audience into a distaste for violence through boredom, it succeeds.
rotten	Mr. Penn, aiming for weary, battered intensity, settles into a zone somewhere between fatigue and indigestion.
rotten	A dum-dum action picture that briefly pretends to be about world aid before returning to muscular, middle-aged men beating the snot out of each other.
rotten	This is a stupid movie about a muscular superman beating and shooting the living hell out of all those who would cross him. It's not an apologia for continental destruction.
fresh	I've pretty much always enjoyed watching Penn in everything, not despite of his hambone tendency to milk every moment of every shot but because of it. This stupid movie is no exception ...
rotten	Whatever else we might think of Sean Penn's bid for an active middle age via The Gunman, we can't doubt his enthusiasm.
rotten	Imagine The Constant Gardener crunched back and forth through Google Translate in several Bantu languages, then fished out of a swamp with pages missing.
fresh	Director Pierre Morel is the real hero here, supercharging the genre material with touches of brilliance.
rotten	OK, we've seen the biceps and the abs. Very nice. Now, back to the brain.
rotten	The movie doesn't quite approach a level of irresponsibility, but its all-around lack of responsibility is off-putting.
rotten	Morel may have some of the world's greatest actors are on hand for the proceedings, but he isn't creative enough to use their talents to effectively elevate the screenplay to something that transcends the genre.
rotten	The only redeeming feature about The Gunman is its exotic locations.
rotten	Penn and his fellow actors are fine at conversation, but there are more dialogue-driven subplots here than a movie full of bullets and land mines requires.
rotten	The Gunman is well-meaning, but it lacks the spark that made Taken such a compelling tale.
rotten	I can imagine Sean Penn agreeing to star in this Taken knockoff on the condition that it educate moviegoers about humanitarian crises in Africa; it does, but the film feels misshapen as a result.
rotten	Bardem appears almost bored playing second fiddle to Penn's mirthless, unapproachable, irritating assassin. Trinca has so little material to work with that her pleasant demeanor can't hold the screen for the brief time she's been allowed.
rotten	Jim is a former bad guy himself, which lends an extra layer of moral ambiguity to the action; not enough to qualify as profundity, but at least it's something more to think about than the snazzy sports car he manages to pick up while on the run.
rotten	"The Gunman" is a predictable slog through action-movie tropes, and Penn's intensity isn't a good fit.
fresh	A well-executed thriller that leaves us stirred but not shaken.
fresh	There's a grubby, redemptive quality that makes this tough-minded flick feel like the son of "Serpico" and "Salvador."
rotten	"The Gunman" may start as a genre exercise of promising purpose, but it winds up being just a lot of bull.
rotten	It's a tasty cast, but the script does not do its job in crucial areas, letting the audience get way, way out ahead of the reveals.
fresh	It succeeds, partly because the moral climate it presents seems so confused, but mainly because of Penn's particular aura of irascible integrity.
rotten	The Gunman felt as long and made me as bored as the fancy rifle he initially shoots with.
rotten	Penn has pumped himself up to absurd dimensions for the role, but it doesn't make him look like a badass; it just makes him look like a movie star who's trying too hard.
rotten	The result is a relentlessly dour film livened up only by Bardem's shameless scenery-chewing and the occasional jolt of action.
rotten	Penn remains a furiously committed method actor, even in a paycheck role such as this one. But he's not enough to prevent the film from becoming the same-old.
rotten	With Morel at the helm this was never going to be more than a dumb shoot 'em up and...well, dumb it certainly is.
rotten	While Sean Penn lends this thriller some political subtext, the fact remains that it's actually just another vacuous revenge fantasy from Taken director Pierre More...
rotten	Almost everything about The Gunman is by-the-numbers, which is fine, but it doesn't even tell a familiar story particularly well.
fresh	Yes, there are plot holes aplenty, but the action is tautly staged by Morel and that makes "The Gunman" a satisfactory time-passer.
rotten	A lightweight thriller posing as a heavy political drama, or vice-versa. Not thoughtful and no fun.
rotten	May it enjoy its second life as a lazy Sunday TV dad movie.
rotten	The Gunman is beautiful on the outside but ugly on the inside.
rotten	There's something especially noxious about the way "The Gunman" (which, surprisingly, Penn co-wrote) uses the genuine historical tragedy of the exploitation of African resources as an excuse for arm-snapping, throat-stabbing, head-shooting action.
rotten	Surprising how much this well-shot disappointment runs from the situation it introduces in order to make sure the white guy gets to the bottom of his own problem.
rotten	The Gunman is too disorganized and sloppy to make sense as political commentary or to work on the most basic level as a globe-trotting chase thriller.
rotten	Too portentous to really entertain, even in spite of itself.
rotten	This is a dull and convoluted mess that takes too long to get going, and unfortunately keeps going and going and going until the silly finale.
rotten	Unfortunately, nobody ever won an Oscar for washboard abs. And nobody is going to win five seconds of admiration for 115 minutes of tedium in The Gunman.
rotten	The Gunman lacks the all-killer, no-filler efficiency of [Pierre Morel's] biggest success, Taken.
rotten	A tired old piece of action junk that expects us to sympathize with a very bad man. We don't.
rotten	Watching Penn pump iron and denounce capitalism for two hours would be roughly as illuminating as this monotonous Euro-thriller.
rotten	Penn conjures no special aura in The Gunman. When it comes to the lunatic game of macho heroics, he's only a super-respectable contender.
rotten	Is it a serious political film tackling the plight of central Africa or a silly blast 'em up that's all about cheap thrills?
rotten	The writing is wooden and Penn obviously knows it... If Penn is helpless against exposition-heavy dialogue, what chance do the other actors stand?
fresh	Generic. Preachy. Predictable. But watchable.
fresh	This is a watchable thriller with enough all-action set pieces to carry you along, particularly a lengthy sequence in the Barcelona bullring.
rotten	While one can certainly see Penn's attraction to a globe-trotting, gun-toting, hard-loving role such as this, one also can't help but wonder how it all falls so flat.
rotten	Too often feels like just another slice of brainless Eurotrash, packed with saw-it-coming plot twists, half-hearted car chases and an angsty hero with zero charisma.
fresh	Penn's need to be seen as a guy of integrity is left naked in The Gunman, but at least he's having some fun with the action-movie trappings, and with taking his shirt off.
fresh	A Sean Penn vehicle affording the surprisingly-buff (if long in the tooth) matinee idol ample opportunities to put his pecs on display in high-impact fight sequences as well as lingering love scenes.
rotten	A genuine disappointment, given the talent involved, and a rare misstep for Penn, who can't save this moribund vanity project.
fresh	For a film with such a thinly worked conspiracy, The Gunman is inexplicably hard to follow, relying on lack of clarity to disguise by-the-numbers plotting. Still, if you're in the market for some well-wrought mayhem, you could certainly do a lot worse.
rotten	A cut above pure exploitation, The Gunman adds a dose of humanitarian medicine to the Taken formula.
rotten	It's crass, clumsy and sometimes shockingly bad.
rotten	The lack of any visual ingenuity, reflexivity, or awareness of genre tropes diminishes the intermittent pleasures of the action's slightly involving kineticism.
rotten	If the matador got gored, this would be a marginally better movie, but Sean Penn's g.f. is too young for him, Javier Bardem is an embarrassment as a drunk, and the frantic fight editing is the usual standard stuff.
rotten	The kind of film that can't be bothered to do any more with its Spanish setting than have a showdown at a bullfight.
rotten	The Gunman needs to be Taken to task.
rotten	The Gunman is nothing more than Sean Penn's mid-life crisis vanity project, and it isn't worth the price of admission.
rotten	Sadly, Penn's veiny, sweat-glazed biceps are the most objectively impressive feature of this rote, humorless thriller, a distinctly unconvincing attempt to refashion the star ... as a middle-aged action hero in the Liam Neeson mold.
rotten	Leisurely, unfocused, and a little too indulgent of its star.
rotten	Ultimately this feels like a vanity project designed to do for Penn's bankability, Africa, Spain and mercenaries what the Taken franchise did for Liam Neeson, Paris and Albanian gangsters.
rotten	What begins and ends as an exploration of Western exploitation of the Congo mostly follows the standard track of the retired hit-man who realizes that he hasn't quite yet eluded the sins of the past.
rotten	Considering the level of talent involved, one would and should expect better.
rotten	Not the same league as Muscle Shoals and 20 Feet from Stardom, but a valuable addition
fresh	This Memory Lane is lined with gold.
fresh	The Wrecking Crew isn't about something falling apart, but a specific moment in time: a time that, as a viewer, you keep wanting to revisit.
fresh	I doubt there will be a more entertaining documentary this year.
fresh	A must-see for liner-note readers.
fresh	The movie really shines in interviews with the Crew themselves, taking on the feeling of an old reunion. These oldies are indeed golden.
fresh	Good-natured look at the virtuoso workhorses of classic rock and pop.
fresh	A music-filled, appreciative but not fawning account of the session musicians who helped make so many of the 1960s' records great.
fresh	"The Wrecking Crew" succeeds as important cultural history. But it's also deeply personal for Tedesco ...
fresh	It can be uncomfortable to pull back the curtain on some of the most beloved rock songs of all time. Yet, it's worth it in order to meet The Wrecking Crew.
fresh	Pays fond tribute to the musicians who were behind so much of the rock 'n' roll soundtrack of boomers' lives [as] an insiders' memoir . . . in loose, not chronological edit.
fresh	The Wrecking Crew is breezy, intriguing, tuneful, joyous stuff for anyone. For rock and pop fans, though, it's absolute catnip.
fresh	The Wrecking Crew is a vital part of the narrative of the golden age of popular music recording, and contains elements that will certainly be used for future, perhaps more sophisticated tellings of this period.
fresh	Inviting and informative, giving needed dimension to blockbuster singles and masterful performers. Utilizing a sensational soundtrack is merely icing on the cake.
fresh	Fans of those great old recordings of the late '60s and '70s will lap this up
rotten	Mostly, it's hagiography, with stars like Cher and Brian Wilson used as character witnesses to the players' greatness.
fresh	'60s and '70s music lovers will rejoice.
rotten	The Wrecking Crew resonates as a hastily assembled missed opportunity, an introduction of interesting, feature-worthy content that spends more than 90 minutes only journeying skin-deep.
fresh	It'll make you listen to "Good Vibrations," a song you've heard a million times, with fresh ears.
fresh	There's lots of interviews with cheerful musicians but not much focus or context. They're wonderful people, though, Kaye and Blaine and Campbell and Tommy Tedeso and Leon Russell and their friends.
fresh	The musicians' memories, coupled with the murderers' row of killer tunes that play on the soundtrack, carry you along and recreate a period in the music industry that's long since vanished.
fresh	The story of studio rock's secret weapon...
fresh	Though their story has taken decades to reach the screen, it has been worth the wait.
fresh	Denny Tedesco's lively and loving documentary takes its title from the name collectively applied to the group of two to three dozen Los Angeles studio musicians who dominated rock and pop recordings there during the 1960s and early '70s.
fresh	With its release held up for seven years because of rights issues, Denny Tedesco's illuminating documentary about the unsung L.A. session musicians who provided the backbeat for some of the greatest songs from the '50s through the '80s can now be seen.
fresh	The studio musicians rarely got credit on or off the albums. In The Wrecking Crew, Denny Tedesco, whose father was a Wrecking Crew guitarist, rights that wrong.
fresh	The unsung heroes who played on stacks of wax during the '60s pop era are celebrated in a hugely entertaining documentary.
fresh	No, nobody emerges as a breakout the way Darlene Love did in "Twenty Feet," but I greatly enjoyed spending 100 minutes with these people.
fresh	The story of The Wrecking Crew always deserved to be told and this incredible documentary does a first class job
fresh	Incredibly engaging and equally informative music documentary.
fresh	Extremely sweet-natured. Short on drama and full of good vibrations, it's awfully hard not to like.
fresh	The Wrecking Crew is a provocative look back at an art form in transition.
fresh	There are a thousand stories to be told in the studios where these session players cut some of the greatest records of all time, which makes it disappointing that there isn't more to be found in "The Wrecking Crew."
fresh	Fascinating ...
fresh	As you attend a master class in music and recording, you also get one of the most entertaining movies of the year.
rotten	Overall, the documentary comes off as a solipsistic, uncritical look at an incredible moment in the history of American music.
fresh	These unsung heroes are the subject of an illuminating, witty and comprehensive documentary by Denny Tedesco, son of the Crew's inventive guitarist, the late Tommy Tedesco.
fresh	With a son's love and duty, Tedesco ... breezily celebrates the team that laid down a thousand riffs back just before pop became too serious for anonymous craftsmanship.
fresh	The majority of 'The Wrecking Crew' is simply listing the many, many, many, many, many songs the subjects helped craft.
fresh	A good "behind the music" genre documentary that took entirely too long to reach theaters and suffers by comparison with some of the films that it inspired.
fresh	The enchanting Kaye - "I was making more money than the President" - probably deserves her own film.
fresh	It's astounding to consider how many eternal earworms are in our brains, courtesy of this accomplished group of West Coast musicians.
fresh	Long on nostalgia, the film does shed further light on the genius of Brian Wilson and the unfair uproar over the Monkees' need for musical backup. Turns out even the Beach Boys required the Wrecking Crew to rock.
fresh	This sing-along, joyful doc unearths a group of musicians who actually played all the music on the LPS by the Byrds, Cher, Nancy and Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, the Monkees, and Captain and Tennille. A must to see and listen to.
fresh	Airplane docu is visually stunning for transportation fans.
rotten	Ideal as a promotional item at a trade convention, the movie pales next to its more nature-oriented large-format competition.
rotten	This giant-screen rhapsody on the power of airplanes to revolutionize the world winds up offering little more than an endorsement of the tourism and shopping industries.
rotten	A compelling story with fascinating characters, undone by a script that does the opposite of what its real-life Liberian missionaries would do: it doesn't take any chances.
fresh	It's a satisfying surprise indeed to find a "Mormon movie" willing to confront the church's legacy of racism head-on.
fresh	Through the adventure, both powerful and funny, Batty and co-screenwriter Melissa Leilani Larson also create a deeply moving depiction of day-to-day missionary work.
fresh	Cinematographer Jeremy Prusso catches some stunning imagery, Robert Allen Elliott's score is genuinely stirring, and the cast, most of whom are from Monrovia, is uniformly excellent.
rotten	Draggy and one-note, [Freetown is] an indie more interested in reaffirming Mormon dogma than in delivering compelling drama.
rotten	A dawdling, flat account of African missionaries on the run from rebels that takes forever to get going and even longer to arrive.
fresh	A startling, strange, and disturbing tale of dogs and men
fresh	What it all means is open to interpretation. Read it as a parable or as a horror movie. Read it as the story of love between a girl and her dog. Read it however you want. No matter what your take, you won't be disappointed.
fresh	Emotionally visceral, visually amazing movie with an underpinned social commentary that hits like a brick. See it.
fresh	As a dark, Eastern European take on "Benji the Hunted," "White God" holds some fascination. But as an indictment of the evil that men do, it's all bark and no bite.
fresh	White God has all the moralistic themes and allegorical elements to make the film evergreen when applied to almost any social, political or socio-economic conflict.
fresh	Dogs run wild in Budapest. Suggests a canine version of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds."
fresh	White God offers a dark - very dark - take on the way humans exert authority, and superiority, over our fellow creatures.
fresh	Kornel Mundruczo knows not of subtlety. The Hungarian director's brash new feature White God is over the top in all kinds of ways, for better and worse.
fresh	Call the shelter; this one's a keeper.
rotten	The obviousness of the message -- follow the right leader -- would be more tolerable in a less badly acted, less shoddy-looking film.
fresh	A mixed-genre fable that evokes Dickensian melodrama, coming-of-age tropes and outright horror.
fresh	Think "The Incredible Journey" crossed with "The Birds" crossed with "Rise of the Planet of the Apes." Or maybe just imagine "Cujo" as told from the dog's point of view. Don't take grandma.
fresh	It all pays off with an astounding, extended climax that is as rousing and exciting as it is frightening - one of the most surreal experiences I've ever had watching a movie.
fresh	Even those who don't buy in completely to Mundruczo's parable will be impressed by his canine crowd scenes, staged with ambition, skill and genuinely original vision.
fresh	Engrossing, and open to any number of metaphorical readings -- but not for people who can't handle simulated animal abuse in movies.
fresh	Unfortunately, whatever satisfaction you may derive from seeing assorted nasty human beings get what's coming to them for betraying the trust of man's best friend is watered down by vague social and political allegory.
fresh	By turns Dickensian, Marxist and dystopian, it's a movie as deliriously unclassifiable as it is expertly focused in its desire to provoke and entertain.
fresh	Intriguing, but the movie's larger statement isn't clear.
fresh	The whole production speaks well for the power of film; it's a serious stunner.
fresh	The film is no more than wildly inventive, engaging, exciting and memorable, with faultless performances by all the humans, and by Luke, Bodie and a Jack Russell terrier mix named Marlene. I can live with the disappointment.
fresh	Rarely does a film's execution achieve or even exceed its director's ambitions, but Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo's "White God" is that rare movie.
fresh	White God is a feat of practical filmmaking...
fresh	Mundruczo's camera is itchy, moving, darting, as if sniffing, a "shaggy dog" approach, little nudges and sneaks ever so closer in scenes where the dogs move closer to war with mankind.
fresh	What holds Kornel Mundruczo's scrappy film all together is its fierce and forceful political metaphor: society's underdogs - be it ethnic minorities, the poor, the disenfranchised - if pushed too far, will bite back (in this case literally).
fresh	The filmmaker was wise choosing a species known for its capacity for unconditional love to make his point, its perversion all the more emotionally wrenching.
fresh	Milo and Otis by way of The Birds by way of I Spit On Your Grave.
fresh	This is fascinating to watch on a purely elemental level, as Mundruczo employs creative smoke-and-mirrors to make once cute dogs seem like menacing terrors.
fresh	Suffers at times from a scattershot tone...(but) Its marauding former pets and unresolved ending reminded me most of Hitchcock's "The Birds." That's certainly not a bad film to aspire to while crafting a needed cautionary tale.
fresh	... there is much to admire in this near exceptional film, and I guarantee you will be fully invested in the two leads.
fresh	Imagine an "R" rated Lassie by way of Spartacus. That's Kornel Mundruczo's White God, a brutal but stirring fantasy about street dogs rising up against cruel and indifferent humans.
fresh	A B revenge movie with A-plus direction by Kornel Mundruczo and a cast of canines so personable that even when they tear out people's throats you still want to take them home.
fresh	A rousing creature-feature thriller and political allegory, from Hungarian director Kornel Mundrucz.
fresh	The hand that feeds - and also brutalizes - is righteously bitten in "White God," a Hungarian revenge fantasy that's like nothing you've seen on screen before.
fresh	Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo downplays White God as a "genre experiment," but his film has real bite regardless.
fresh	Somewhere between the future shock allegories of the '70s and their TV spin-offs circa The ABC Movie of the Week lies White God.
rotten	White God wants audiences to be moved because stray dogs are persecuted like homeless people. But viewers are prodded to despise the one actual street person in the movie for taking advantage of a dog.
fresh	The screen teems with vitality and energy whenever the dogs return to center stage.
fresh	When the violence gets unbearable, take comfort in the troop of trainers on the sidelines who prove that, for now, man and beast still make a good team.
fresh	Makes Lassie Come Home look like a stroll through Pet Smart.
rotten	It's ruthless but sentimental, gritty but fanciful, drop-dead serious but also a little impossible to take seriously.
fresh	I want to hug all the dogs in White God, as well as thank them for their performances in this intense and moving drama.
rotten	...could all just be an ineptly handled gag, like the agit-prop Euro-Benji film it occasionally resembles.
fresh	Director Kornel Mundruczo goes big with allegory, violence, drama and sentiment, and the results are riveting.
rotten	Imagine a gritty version of the 'Simpsons' episode where Santa's Little Helper runs away and becomes a scary fighting mutt - shorn of the Laddie subplot, alas.
fresh	"White God" isn't the first film to suggest that humanity's cruel treatment of others will one day come back to haunt us. But it certainly makes its point with potent force.
fresh	Striking, grim, darkly funny at times. But who, exactly, is going to want to watch a movie built around graphic dog abuse?
fresh	The more you command it to sit and stay-to settle down as a plausible plot, or to cohere as a political fable-the more it slips its leash and runs amok.
fresh	A poignant Hungarian parable about the terrible things that can happen when there is no reverence for dogs as fellow companions.
rotten	It affects a general air of artistically inclined realism, but it's mostly concerned with building tension via a steady accumulation of flatly conceived misery.
fresh	This gripping suspense story considers how any canine can become the unfortunate repository for its master's darkest impulses.
fresh	"Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo's brave and tantalizing movie"
fresh	A wonderful movie that scores high as political allegory, Grand Guignol, and coming-of-age drama.
fresh	Beauty and the Beast with bared teeth.
fresh	Director Kornel Mundruczo's staging of the scenes in which the dogs take to the streets is breathtaking.
fresh	White God is perhaps the greatest dog movie made without CGI.
fresh	White God isn't for everyone. But it is an unflinching, extraordinary piece of film-making.
fresh	A beautiful and bizarre film that veers between gritty realism and haunting fantasy, and from a human perspective to a dog's-eye-view of the world.
fresh	Superbly acted allegorical drama with a climax that is not only breathtakingly exciting but flawlessly handled.
fresh	This is an entertaining, technically accomplished work, but unlike the 1982 Samuel Fuller race-relations thriller which the title references, its set-up ultimately proves distracting.
fresh	White God is an ambitious and thrilling, if a little uneven, canine-centric drama.
fresh	Who let the dogs out? This is Homeward Bound: The Incredibly Harrowing Journey ...
fresh	This powerful Hungarian drama features the Al Pacino of dog actors.
fresh	Mundruczo skillfully weaves adventure, coming-of-age, prison-escape and revenge-thriller tropes into a mythic, emotional and visceral experience that poses moral questions about how people treat animals and how people treat people.
fresh	A broad but often poignant allegory of oppression, it's like the beautiful puppy of Au Hasard Balthazar and The Plague Dogs.
fresh	Both a powerful statement for animal rights as well as a metaphorical commentary on the rise of racism in Hungary today.
fresh	White God is a breathtaking beast of its own.
fresh	an astonishing live-action fable in a dog-eat-dog world.
fresh	A sort of apocalyptic fable in which the maltreatment of lowly animals becomes a potent metaphor for everything from immigration to the abuse of power ...
fresh	...a triumphantly idiosyncratic film with smarts and visceral impact in equal measure.
fresh	It is a fantasia of canine madness that looks sometimes like a horror-thriller based on something by James Herbert or Stephen King - and sometimes like a tribute to Hitchcock's The Birds. Except that this time it's The Dogs.
fresh	Kornel Mundruczo's sixth and best feature is an emotionally rousing, technically masterful man-vs.-dog adventure.
rotten	A well-intentioned disaster, only slightly redeemed by a committed performance by Sean Bean, whose talent proves nowhere near enough to make this manipulative tripe more digestible.
rotten	A cliche-ridden, heavy-handed redemptive drama written and directed by Rustam Branaman.
rotten	Any Day falls into the painfully crowded trough between not-bad and seriously not-good movies.
rotten	Branaman's script piles on low-level drama, bad decisions, and enough misdirection to make the film's baffling ending feel not just unearned, but entirely unbelievable.
rotten	Either one of the most poorly edited features I've seen this year, or director Rustam Branaman is trying to pull off a colossal cinematic prank.
fresh	We know war is petty, we know it kills and divides, but Tangerines saddens us and makes us feel the pains of war, when it really counts.
fresh	The film works not because of any kind of historical specificity but because of its ability to simplify.
fresh	Writer-director Zaza Urushadze turns this fragile premise into a superior chamber drama.
fresh	Tangerines offers a relatively quiet reflection on the important elements in life. But the movie feels like the first two acts in a morality play, and I want to see the third.
fresh	Tangerines, the first Estonian picture nominated for the foreign-film Oscar, has a heart as ripe as the citrus fruit of its title, but its message doesn't yield much juice.
fresh	The acting is solid; Ulfsak is ideally cast as the easygoing, timeworn woodworker.
fresh	Georgian writer-director Zaza Urushadze avoids histrionics or moralizing, relying on a strong cast that expresses the film's central argument about war's absurdity largely through taciturn action, not words.
fresh	Simple, direct and achingly melancholy, "Tangerines" unfolds in a setting that feels timeless. Urushadze's filmmaking feels timeless, too, and it's rich, lovingly observed, masculine work that successfully shrugs off the temper of "macho."
rotten	There are some touching interactions between the players, but the film's humanism is too predictably calibrated.
fresh	It might be willfully naive, but it also successfully argues that the path to peace begins with a laying down of not only guns, but also cynicism and distrust.
fresh	"Tangerines" is an example of lean, unadorned old-school filmmaking where familiar style and technique combine to unexpectedly potent effect because of the great skill with which they've been employed.
rotten	Because the conflict between Abkhazians and Georgians is so sketchily drawn, the ultimate heartwarming tone of the film seems not so much unearned as unspectacular.
fresh	Tangerines becomes an object lesson in the resilience of ancient animosities, and the limits, sadly, of common sense.
rotten	Excellent performances from the ensemble cast [...] elevate what is an otherwise theatrical treatment of a timeworn narrative.
fresh	By the end, Georgian director-writer Zaza Urushadze has performed a small miracle by presenting the insanity of war in such a compact form.
rotten	Tangerines ends up being serviceably bleak, but rarely compelling.
rotten	Every time the viewer feels OK to kick back they're whacked them over the head by crude message-mongering or unsubtle ironies.
fresh	"Tangerines" is a modest film, sure of its proportions and clear about its intentions. The key to its effectiveness lies with the actors ...
fresh	This remarkable piece of antiwar cinema honors its theme, and the movie medium.
rotten	The shift from philosophical parrying to actual combat doesn't make Tangerines more compelling; on the contrary, it suggests that the filmmakers didn't have the confidence to tell their story without falling back on genre tropes.
rotten	Urushadze's excellent cast imbues their thinly drawn characters with a great deal of life, but the roles are so transparent that the film feels like more of an advertisement for peace than it does an argument for it.
fresh	The film telegraphs its pacifist message early on, but it's still deeply affecting.
fresh	As a writer-director, Urushadze has the vision to come up with lingering images-like Ivo's long, sensitive hands guiding pieces of wood to a buzzing saw-and the taste and the film sense to pick them up again only when needed.
fresh	Tangerines works primarily as a showcase for its trio of lead actors, who work hard to make their characters' gradual yet quick thaw seem not just credible, but inevitable.
fresh	A thoughtful, quietly compelling parable set in a time of civil war.
fresh	Small in scale if huge in heart and scope, Tangerines uses four characters to limn the religio-nationalistic hostilities unleashed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992.
fresh	The cinema, so infatuated with loud bangs and flowering orange blasts, does, as Ivo says, cheat us. Director/writer Zaza Urushadze instead gives us a clever, claustrophobic plot befitting a three-act play.
fresh	Tangerines is a tense, moving, nuanced anti-war drama.
rotten	For all of the potential, historically specific revelations regarding nation and religion, Tangerines elects to become bathetic hokum.
fresh	Accompanied by a melancholy but atmopsheric refrain from Niaz Diasamidz, which gives an excellent sense of place as well as adding to the elegiac mood, the film is a great example of how powerful and universal small but well-crafted stories can be.
fresh	Slaps an honest emotional sincerity and a dry, almost humorous pragmatism in the face of macho posturing and identity tribalism.
fresh	In an age of incestuous ties between the Pentagon and Hollywood that produces films like "American Sniper", thank god for the Estonians who remind us of what a horror war is.
fresh	A most effective antiwar movie though an oversimplification that seems to say that if you get two enemies to sit down with each other over soup, shashlik and a hard-boiled egg, a peace treaty will soon emerge.
fresh	Although the subject of civil war within the former Soviet countries has been tackled in other movies, this retelling is one of the most concise and affecting.
fresh	A small-scale, poignant and accessible anti-war statement.
fresh	It's solid stuff; well played, affectionately told, and still stirring in its role reversals, both personal and political.
fresh	A loving, faithful portrait of an era which was, let's face it, a bit dull. It feels like Victorians the way they wanted to see themselves more than Victorians as they actually were.
fresh	The magnificent Mulligan - grabbing our attention from the moment she appears in a tight-fitting strikingly dashing russet leather jacket to gallop across the Dorset countryside - rightly dominates this ravishing costume drama.
fresh	Bathsheba's three suitors represent...intimate friendship, sex and comfortable safety - but the new film flubs the character of the seducer...One cannot help but wonder what, say, Robert Pattinson might have brought to this role.
fresh	Handsomely mounted, this is a period drama in which both unspoken demands and stated appetites drive the emotions that simmer below the surface from the first frame.
fresh	A chance to see another fine portrayal by Mulligan, and an opportunity to spend a few hours in a fevered fantasy world of prim and proper ladies and hot-headed shepherd boys.
fresh	The Victorian-era heroine is cast as a feminist in director Thomas Vinterberg's sumptuous adaptation.
rotten	While the costumes and the scenery look great, there's not much beneath the surface.
fresh	A film that feels charged with life and hunger and romantic-erotic energy, with the ever-present danger of fire and storm and financial catastrophe that connected life in 19th-century rural England to the Middle Ages, and to mythology.
fresh	The madding now comes so close on the heels of the gladding and the sadding, that it isn't until the very end, that you realize you've been artfully shepherded - stampeded, really - right off an emotional cliff.
fresh	Because Mulligan's Bathsheba is such an encompassing portrait, I never felt as if I was watching a "type." Bathsheba, with all her warring impulses, is ferociously her own woman.
fresh	Less ethereal and flirty than Julie Christie's Bathsheba, Mulligan anchors the film and stirs the viewer with her contradiction-filled, flesh-and-blood, dynamic portrait of a norm-busting Hardy heroine.
rotten	What viewers are left with is a flop of a film that weakly gestures at ideas that deserve a lot better.
fresh	Mulligan is terrific in this role, her multivalent delivery of the dialogue doing much to enrich her character.
rotten	In the end, this Far From the Madding Crowd is a handsome but bloodless version of the Hardy classic.
fresh	A lovely looking, sweetly scored mid- market diversion.
fresh	Just try to stop yourself from swooning.
fresh	Vinterberg is clearly more interested in the characters' emotional, romantic entanglements than in being stuffy or classy.
fresh	Vinterberg may rush the final act, but he brings out the wild side in Mulligan, who can hold a close-up like nobody's business. She's a live wire in a movie that knows how to stir up a classic for the here and now.
rotten	The fact that this film prompts not a sob but a shrug is a tragedy all of its own.
fresh	Lovers of period drama should not feel disappointed but it does lack some of the wild passion and intensity required truly to capture your heart.
fresh	Mulligan is spot-on, the rest hovers between solid and forgettable.
rotten	Feels like a missed opportunity to do a country romantic melodrama in grand style.
fresh	A thoroughly modern film anyone can relate to - it's like a "what a woman wants" discussion set in Victorian times. It's also an instant classic.
fresh	Brilliant counter programming to the impending onslaught of superheroes and excessive noise in the multiplex is this vigorous, melodramatic re-imagining of rural Victorian England.
fresh	There is romance and drama in the story, tragedy and betrayal, but it engages in a bracing fashion with issues of class, honor, and values.
fresh	The film is at its strongest in the scenes between Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts).
fresh	I was captivated. Carey Mulligan gives an Oscar (R)-quality performance; it never occurred to me that she was acting...ably supported by a fine cast and beautiful cinematography. This is one of the best films I've seen this century.
fresh	A glowing Carey Mulligan illuminates the screen as Bathsheba Everdene in this lush adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd.
fresh	The story remains gripping and the cast is wonderful, with Mulligan proving an altogether less tortured Hardy heroine than usual.
fresh	There is much pleasure in watching these fine actors navigate rough emotional waters, each conveying as much in sidewise glances as they do in direct discourse.
fresh	All in all, it's a perfectly decent take on Hardy's timeless tale.
fresh	"Far from the Madding Crowd" has its appeal. Yet like unrequited love, one can't help but lament what might have been.
fresh	It's buoyant, pleasant and easygoing. That's a recommendation of sorts, and also an expression of disappointment.
fresh	A woman fights to keep her freedom in Thomas Hardy's love quadrangle, rendered visually by director Thomas Vinterberg in a poised, crisp, and actor-centric film.
fresh	pleasant if predictable
fresh	Far from the Madding Crowd is pretty to look at, even if it is a sort of SparkNotes version of Thomas Hardy's novel.
fresh	An amazing meditation on yearning and the brimming hearts of three men and the woman they all want to marry.
fresh	It is also beautifully filmed, offering a vivid sense of both time and place as the camera scans the rugged beauty of the rural landscape, but mostly it is what you want any drama to be: involving.
rotten	For a story that's all about choice and consequence, the way it rips through plot points in the latter half makes the ending feel more like an inevitable contrivance than a maturation. Although, in fairness, the scenery always stays just as beautiful.
rotten	In trying to create a feminist icon out of a decidedly Victorian character (just look at her name), the movie loses sight of the actual story it came to tell.
fresh	An enthralling, complex, nimbly acted drama with a sweeping romance that doesn't shy away from sexual politics.
rotten	Bathsheba should be more than a dress-up doll, and the rest more than a potboiler. Lost in the gloss is Hardy's weirdness, and with it half his greatness.
fresh	It's a wholly respectable adaptation, though perhaps a flash or two more of wildness wouldn't have gone amiss.
fresh	This filmed version of Hardy's fourth novel is well worth seeing. It rises head and shoulders above most of what we've been seeing lately.
fresh	If there's one complaint about "Far From the Madding Crowd," it's that the chemistry between Mulligan and Schoenaerts doesn't totally spark. But then, how much pizzazz does one really expect from Victorian England?
fresh	As a cinematic condensation, it mostly works, even if the pace sometimes feels a bit frantic.
rotten	A "Far From the Madding Crowd" in which romance is a matter of audience indifference or benign mystification is an adaptation not firing on all cylinders.
fresh	This new take on the Thomas Hardy classic vividly captures the story's modern themes through complex performances from a sharp cast...
fresh	This is a classic story told with genuine craft, and featuring a truly great performance by Carey Mulligan.
rotten	It struggles, like so many Thomas Hardy adaptations before it, to find a purpose for itself beyond "widescreen study guide." Picturesque and impersonal, it evacuates incident upon incident, as though Hardy's plotting were the runs.
fresh	Waiting in rapt, nail-biting tension for even the tiniest bit of catharsis equates to wonderful drama, and if adorable hats can also enter into the equation, all the better.
rotten	Will no doubt captivate future generations of tenth-graders who couldn't be bothered to read the book, but it flattens the complex characters and grand scope of Hardy's novel into an airless and overly truncated CliffsNotes version.
fresh	"Far From the Madding Crowd" is one the most satisfying, finest romantic period dramas to grace screens, big or small, in awhile.
fresh	Even if you don't consider yourself an easy mark for literary bodice-rippers served with a side of sexual politics, this Madding Crowd gives you plenty of reason to swoon.
fresh	[VIDEO ESSAY] What a difference a remake can make.
fresh	It's easy to read this 19th century tale as modern and feminist, but it's even more exciting is how right it gets sloppy, not always sensible emotions.
fresh	Ultimately, this is a romance, so our heroine never strays too far from the appointed path - and its swoony end - but the director also gives her space to explore what it might be like to, well, just have your own piano.
fresh	A well-cast period romance aching with longing
fresh	Ridiculously romantic in all the best ways, and more modern, more progressive, and even just plain more grownup that half the movies thrown at us today.
fresh	Sprawling romantic novels such as Hardy's are often best suited to serial television, because bringing heart and mind into sync takes time, so it's just as well that - apart from the brutal tailoring - Mulligan is seamless.
rotten	Tom Sturridge is too numbly featureless to channel the cruel but sexy Sergeant Troy; they don't call them wooden soldiers for nothing. Sadly, his performance is perhaps the perfect counterpart to Mulligan's.
fresh	Madding Crowd will remind viewers of how hungry they are for an epic romance minus the cynicism and snark.
fresh	I was never a fan of the 1967 version with Julie Christie, but director Thomas Vinterberg gets it all right this time with this hugely romantic adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel that features a never-better Carey Mulligan in the lead role.
fresh	Carey Mulligan's commanding performance is an easy beacon to follow: her Bathsheba is caught between the vulnerability of youth and the strength of knowing her own value.
fresh	For all the bucolic beauty and ravishing romance, we're reminded that violence is never far from the surface - and Vinterberg captures the brewing tragedy magnificently.
fresh	Extremely well done and well acted, it's an attractive, appealing, involving adaptation, just not as iconic as the '60s film.
fresh	Though its social scope is narrower than Hardy's, you do come away from it with a true sense of the shrouded world that he devised, where fate could frown upon even the blithest day.
rotten	The lack of real analysis or consideration leaves this perilously close to a Goldilocks-style depiction of privileged female indecision.
fresh	David Nicholls deserves huge credit for condensing Hardy's sprawling melodrama into a rollicking screenplay that comes in at under two hours and still hits all the major plot points.
fresh	Carey Mulligan is a delight to watch in her authentic recreation of a feminist looking for a man who is able to "tame" her.
fresh	[It] has one great strength: an outstanding performance in this difficult, perhaps fundamentally incoherent, role from Carey Mulligan, far more intense, compelling and modern than Christie, much more intimately filmed.
fresh	With dashing redcoats, picturesque bucolic vistas and heaving bosoms aplenty, there is more than enough in Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's gorgeous adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel to treat any lingering Poldark withdrawal symptoms.
rotten	Boasts fine performances and pristine technical credits, but fails to make a deep connection as it jolts awkwardly towards a sweet finale.
fresh	What does register at every turn is a vibrant sense of time and place that pulls us into Hardy's bygone world even when the drama falters.
fresh	This is an interesting, heartfelt but flawed Hardy adaptation.
fresh	Nicely served on both sides of the camera, this is a concise and involving rendition of the story of a resilient young woman who comes into property in Victorian England's West Country and is courted by three suitors, all of whom have pluses and minuses.
fresh	Must-see rock doc.
fresh	From this vantage point, what's most miraculous is that, almost by accident, Lambert and Stamp corralled the chaos of four unsightly, sulky talents and fashioned it into something for the ages.
fresh	Lambert and Stamp played a crucial, heretofore largely hidden, role in shaping pop-culture history - not to mention the noisy, visceral, rebellious zeitgeist of th-th-th-their generation.
fresh	Refreshingly free-form, rough-riffing, pastiche portrait of an era.
fresh	Proves the value in having an oral history experienced visually rather than just verbally.
rotten	If you're not a world-class Who fan, this is deep inside baseball. If, like me, you are, it seems like a missed opportunity ...
fresh	The film is fascinating in its exploration of the give-and-take between art and commerce.
fresh	The fascinating part of this origin story is that one of history's best known bands found success not at the hands of a music producer but in the custody of two filmmakers.
fresh	"Lambert & Stamp" is a niche film, but it is a big niche with generations of Who fans that have been loyal to the band for decades.
fresh	You don't need to be fan of The Who to enjoy this documentary. It's universal themes include an analysis of opposites attracting, genius marketing, creative nurturing and the inevitable clashing dynamics of a rock 'n roll band.
fresh	First things first: If you're a fan of The Who, you're going to love Lambert & Stamp.
fresh	A vital and untethered account of one of the prime bands of its era, along with a revealing portrait of that era.
fresh	Lovingly documents the ways in which two unlikely men, largely improvising through an unfamiliar world, harnessed a unique energy that still propels one of the great bands.
fresh	Fascinating, but almost as chaotic and disorganized as the band itself
fresh	For all the Who's flamboyance and rock-god excess, the more fascinating story behind them may well have been that of Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp ...
fresh	A sharply crafted, highly entertaining portrait of two young Londoners who made their names and fortunes by managing a fledgling band called the High Numbers, who became The Who.
fresh	The band's first managers take center stage in this fascinating time capsule of swinging '60s London: Kit Lambert was a blue blood with a dizzying musical IQ; Chris Stamp had the Carnaby Street flash.
fresh	What sets Lambert & Stamp apart from the common rock documentary is that its focus isn't on the band, but the big-thinking management duo behind them ... It's a refreshing angle.
fresh	Although Lambert .. died in 1981, his presence is felt in the rich archival footage and the perceptive on-screen accounts that compellingly demonstrate the alchemy that can transpire when kismet and perseverance intersect ...
fresh	There is enough archival footage to make you feel as if you were there, or at least sorry that you missed it all.
fresh	They weren't much to look at, but with a little backstage help, they saw for miles. Lambert & Stamp never makes it so far, but it's an admirable addendum to rock history.
fresh	Fans of The Who will find this film a rock Rosetta Stone. Students of the often anarchic creative process will be fascinated.
rotten	Pop oral history at its most formless and fannish: fixated on juicy tidbits, points of influences, and historical cameos, and sorely lacking a point of view.
fresh	Many great docs have been made about The Who (including the ecstatic "The Kids Are All Right"), but "Lambert & Stamp" gets closest to the band's fragility and unlikely story.
rotten	Shot through with '60s London energy, illuminating on several fronts and featuring bits of many great Who tracks, the film is nevertheless a mess that should be taught in film schools to illustrate how not to edit a documentary.
fresh	James D. Cooper treats Lambert & Stamp as the cinematic equivalent of a rich oral history, letting the principal players talk, often at length, about their experiences.
fresh	[Lambert & Stamp] will mean the most for those with a deep appreciation for the minutiae of British rock 40 years ago.
fresh	The rare truthful and beautiful film about the rock 'n' roll life.
fresh	Riotously entertaining.
fresh	Blessed with a wealth of golden b&w footage, James D. Cooper's poundingly fun, scrappy profile has an unusually satisfying nuts-and-bolts perspective on the '60s fame machine.
fresh	A wonderfully alive behind-the-music chronicle that rescues two genuine mavericks from the footnotes of rock history.
fresh	[VIDEO ESSAY] Even if you've never heard of "The Who," as improbable as that seems, "Lambert & Stamp" is an infectiously captivating retelling of that brilliant band's origin and strange journeys...
fresh	James D. Cooper's impeccably directed debut is a definitive screen bio of the Who and its-rock operatic rise.
fresh	Arrives someplace quite different from traditional revenge tales.
fresh	Broodingly effective as a crime drama because it's driven by family dynamics as much as the mechanics of transgression.
fresh	A quiet, contemplative film that shows how one small act of rebellion and violence can escalate and destroy a family. Great performances and cinematography work hampered by an unnecessary twist ending.
fresh	A somber piece of film poetry about men so invested in a rigid notion of honor and revenge they become trapped in an endless loop of violence.
fresh	Munzi's meticulous scene-setting allows tension to build gradually, the camera idling on darkly lit interiors and contrasting these spaces with the decaying beauty of similarly long exterior shots of the village.
fresh	Munzi builds slowly, inexorably, to an ending that's as shocking as it is inevitable. He's more interested in character development, offhand gibes over pasta and wine, than he is 'Goodfellas' shootouts.
fresh	Tales of Italians and organized crime are, quite frankly, starting to wear thin after years of overuse. But "Black Souls" has a deep and startling soulfulness that, despite its shocking conclusion, is profoundly moving.
fresh	A real life interpretation of the "Godfather" series that strips away the glamour and leaves only despair.
fresh	It may not quite have the explosive charm of some of the classics, but Black Souls is an elegant, unsettling addition to the gangster-movie canon. Get on its unique wavelength, and you may find it transfixing.
fresh	If you're looking for an intelligent, atmospheric, slow-burning crime drama that's anti-Hollywood, Black Souls won't disappoint you.
fresh	"Black Souls" isn't quite the great film the international cinema buzz machine has touted it to be in some circles, but it is a very good one, the kind that ends with such gravity that you feel its weight for a while after.
fresh	"Black Souls" is an ominous, well-acted portrait of an ingrown feudal society of violence, retaliation and deadly machismo.
fresh	Dispenses with the romanticized version of the mafia in American films and depicts the reality most Italians know: pointless violence and greed that eats away at society.
fresh	An undeniably powerful piece of work.
fresh	"Black Souls" hurts.
fresh	Black Souls is chilling, but it's also familiar.
fresh	"Black Souls" is a solid example of the recent string of Italian mob dramas that utilizes a somber and reflective tone as opposed to the more flashy and stylized approach of American crime epics
rotten	The ensemble cast is strong, and the filmmaking supple, but the narrative never quite catches fire.
fresh	Black Souls spins an elegant yet intense tragedy about the unexpected turns violence can take.
fresh	The makers of Black Souls, a superior Italian gangster movie, deserve praise for executing with atypical sensitivity a generic times-are-changing/nostalgia-for-an-imaginary-chivalrous-yesteryear scenario.
fresh	Black Souls... chooses the classic route of Greek tragedy, which is a natural match for the hard-faced, tight-lipped characters who spiral into general disaster.
fresh	Scenes are allowed to build slowly, and while at first the narrative seems difficult to fully grasp, the elements all fall into place.
fresh	A shaded, slow-burning crime drama from the Italian director Francesco Munzi.
fresh	What Black Souls does very well is to recapture the essential primitivism of conflicts based upon honour, fear of insult and the desire for revenge.
fresh	A film that can be frustrating in its steadfast refusal to be clear about who's who, but by the end has become an effective neo-noirish parable about how slippery and shifting the truth is.
fresh	This cosmopolitan noir thriller sometimes raises more questions than it has answers, just like its characters, but remains a compelling and well-acted murder mystery.
fresh	Boyle, known best for a string of winning romantic comedies (Surrogate Valentine, Daylight Savings) now finds himself making a successful leap to the dark side with this decidedly "hard-Boyled" genre picture.
fresh	Man From Reno is more old-fashioned than postmodern, steeped in the scenic San Fran of Vertigo.
fresh	The moody Man From Reno,/i> is a slow-burn, atmospheric, low-budget thriller that also offers an intriguing blast of culture clash.
fresh	If you can hang on for close to two hours with almost no resolution, it's worth the ride.
fresh	A fine showreel of local talent, writer-director David Boyle's methodical thriller is steeped in the rich tradition of San Francisco noir, yet never suffocates under its influences.
fresh	Fujitani's Aki is a charmingly curious, touchingly sad, consistently smart noir heroine. Serna, a longtime character actor, excels as the small-town sheriff treading an unfamiliarly cruel landscape. He never seems stock.
rotten	Instead of building toward a climax, the film drifts off into nothingness, with a last scene that will send people shuffling out of the theater thinking, "Who cares?"
fresh	Writer-director Dave Boyle is best known for his offbeat rom-coms with San Francisco musician Goh Nakamura (Surrogate Valentine, Daylight Savings), and his gift for eccentric characters redeems this standard whodunit.
fresh	This inscrutable adventure proves a pure delight to unravel from beginning to end.
fresh	An intricately, even densely, plotted mystery/thriller that casts an unusual spell from its opening scene.
fresh	"Man From Reno" fascinates. It invites you to go back, decipher its clues and discern a grand design, if there is one.
fresh	Like any good purveyor of noir, Boyle, who wrote the film with Joel Clark and Michael Lerman, understands that identifying someone is only one endgame while the mystery of identity is naggingly, tragically endless.
fresh	An evocative film noir set in San Francisco and a nearby small town.
fresh	The droll joke is that Asian double-crossers have it even easier than Vertigo's Kim Novak -- Westerners don't even try to tell them apart.
fresh	Man From Reno doesn't rush its revelations, instead inviting the viewer to revel in its atmosphere of cozy foreboding-the same kind you get from a good airport paperback.
fresh	A rare delight that's laced with melancholy and a suffocating sense of menace from its first scene straight through its shocking finale, Man From Reno is made special by the collisions between its characters.
fresh	Boyle's mystery is both maddening in how much it withholds from the viewer trying to play along, and impressive for how little you end up caring about being kept in the dark.
fresh	A neo-noir so subtle you might not even realize it's a neo-noir until things have turned hairy.
fresh	They've devised an ending that departs from genre convention in an arresting way.
fresh	Man from Reno seems primed to become a cult hit, and fans will be justly singing its praises for many years to come.
fresh	Dave Boyle's dreamy, laconic neo-noir plays out kind of like an episode of Murder She Wrote as filtered through the minds of the Coen brothers.
fresh	A polished film that acknowledges its place in the canon of American mysteries and makes a worthy contribution.
fresh	A stylishly made genre film that revels in its old-fashioned sense of mystery and suspense.
fresh	Man From Reno is hardly the equal of its inspirations, but it nonetheless makes for a pleasantly mellow, well-structured concoction.
fresh	Polished and ambitious, this crime drama puts a fresh bicultural spin on a retro-style mystery but doesn't quite sustain the suspense.
rotten	All of Man of Reno is charming. So terribly, terribly charming.
fresh	Dave Boyle's "Man From Reno" is the type of film where alleyways are home offices, every bar matchbox has an unknown number inside, and if a character enters a bookshop, you better believe old issues of "True Detective" are hanging visibly in frame.
fresh	Like his two leads, Boyle maintains a matter-of-factness that allows us to survey the evidence and reach our own conclusions.
fresh	"GETT" shows that sexism is not an aberration, but baked in by design into some of our deepest institutions, and fighting it is a long journey down a hard road.
fresh	It's tough and unsparing, but the grimness is never gratuitous.
fresh	Ultimately the movie is wearying, but then it's likely supposed to be. If Viviane's going through the wringer, you're going through the wringer too.
fresh	A frequently stunning examination of frustration and indignity.
fresh	What the film, directed by Elkabetz and her sibling, Ronit, does, is cast a harsh light on a dark segment of Israeli society that is mostly obscured from the outside world.
fresh	Embattled and infuriating, Israel's submission for the Foreign Language Academy Award epitomizes the concept of male entitlement.
fresh	What initially seems daunting and repetitive, blossoms into a riveting exercise in profundity, building toward a wrenching third act that's as suspenseful as it is disturbing.
fresh	Smooth, subtle and continually disturbing.
fresh	The kind of tragic and absurd blend that can only be labeled as Kafkaesque.
fresh	An unrelenting and important expose of a system that, as depicted here, has no place in the modern world.
fresh	Shot in intense close-ups, the better to study the emotions burning off the characters' skin, the film is all talk and gestures, but it begins to take your breath away like a chase movie would.
fresh	...the largely black and white palette of both the set and the characters' clothing creates a sense of unreality that emphasizes how removed the court's deliberations are from real life as it is lived outside the courtroom.
fresh	A microcosm of women victimized by patriarchal institutions worldwide as well as an allegory of the universal struggle for freedom.
fresh	As Viviane laments, this kind of thing wouldn't happen in America. True, but there's not an actress in America who wouldn't twist her hair into a bun for the chance to play this role.
fresh	Suspenseful, wonderfully acted, emotionally jarring.
fresh	An overwhelmingly intense film about an Orthodox Jewish Israeli woman trying to get a religious divorce.
fresh	Though there is no action, there is vibrancy to the dialog that enthralls for the duration of the film.
fresh	Sibling writer/directors Ronit & Shlomi Elkabetz turn a spotlight on an Israeli women's rights issue using drama, comedy and farce in a stylized courtroom procedural like no other.
fresh	One doesn't have to have seen the previous films in the trilogy for 'Gett' to provide a searing view of the Israeli system of divorce, or to make one feel deeply for a modern woman trapped in its religious intricacies.
fresh	Ronit Elkabetz holds the camera with great skill. Through its claustrophobia and muted hues, this drama gives you a new appreciation of color and freedom.
fresh	How this did not beat out "Ida" for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars last Sunday I will never understand.
fresh	This movie manages to get under your skin unlike most other films you're likely to see.
fresh	The filmmakers impressively indict an egregiously sexist policy that regards women as men's property.
fresh	The power of the film's critique is in the overall sensation of a claustrophobic, seemingly endless, and Kafkaesque nightmare from which no one can escape...
fresh	[Gett] is as tightly crafted as any courtroom thriller. The difference here is that what hangs in the balance is not guilt or innocence, freedom or the death penalty, but a very different kind of life sentence.
fresh	The set-up can seem frustratingly constrictive and redundant, but that's the point. The film is no more exasperating than the rigid, patriarchal legal system it depicts.
fresh	It may puzzle audiences unfamiliar with the Israeli system but the rigid religious bureaucracy devoted to keeping a married couple together at all cost makes for a superb way of adding layers of tension to this effective drama.
fresh	Elkabetz commands the screen whether she's quietly seething or lashing out at the judges and their pointed questions. Her plight provides a painful argument that marriage - and divorce - are better served in the civil sphere.
fresh	One feels the oppressiveness of Israeli domestic law, but how one is supposed to feel about the subjects isn't clear.
fresh	Despite the seemingly uncinematic nature of this inert, even claustrophobic scenario, the film mesmerizes, utterly.
fresh	A highly compressed, exquisitely acted tale of two people who do not belong together plays out as a courtroom saga that, in story terms, runs longer than many marriages.
fresh	A world is constructed inside a spare room; the camera doesn't move, cutting between medium shots and close-ups, with each placement reflecting a Sisyphean quest for freedom.
fresh	Ronit Elkabetz is the star of the show. For a film enamored of faces, hers is most important, and what she does with it is magnificent.
fresh	This may not sound like the merriest way to spend time in a movie theater, but Gett is compelling from its first frame.
fresh	Every shot, cut, line, performance, indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged, always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in to define its characters and move the story forward.
fresh	Almost all of the film takes place inside a courtroom, at irregular intervals over five years, but there is no sense of drag or slump; on the contrary, the action quivers with tension, impatience, comic heat, and, beneath it all, an irrepressible rage.
fresh	Forcefully crystallizes juxtaposition of hypocrisy, cynicism, frustration and absurdity when a woman is forced to abide ancient rules. . . caught in colorful and funny tales.
fresh	Gripping cinema from start to finish, almost implausibly so.
fresh	The divorce-centered drama is so provocative it's become a lightning rod for debate inside the country. Even watching from a distance is unnerving.
fresh	Methodical and agonizing, much like the five-year dispute it depicts.
fresh	This all might be laughable if it wasn't based on the very real facts of the Israeli court system, which as portrayed here is like Kafka without the surrealist trappings.
fresh	Gett has a formal rigor that works like a vise.
fresh	The acting, especially from Menash Noy as an ineffectual attorney, is phenomenal, resulting in a feminist knockout told in inverse.
fresh	A couple of plot turns threaten to overload the drama, but overall this divorce is more riveting than many a murder trial.
fresh	Ronit Elkabetz gives a lively and at times moving performance as Viviane.
fresh	I nevertheless found myself pretty much mesmerized by every frame of it.
fresh	[A] ferocious portrait of a woman who is desperately fighting Jewish religious dictates to regain her freedom from an arranged marriage.
fresh	In the hands of sister-brother co-directors Ronit Elkabetz (who also co-stars) and Shlomi Elkabetz this patriarchal legal loophole becomes the wellspring for densely rich drama, told with stringent austerity but also humor and judicious empathy.
fresh	Siblings Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz bring their blistering trilogy of male domination in an Israeli family to a rewarding close with Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem.
fresh	The film never devolves into finger-wagging hysterics thanks to Ronit and brother/co-director Shlomi Elkabetz's keen attention to their actors' performances, especially Ronit's star turn.
fresh	The courtroom's cramped, near-featureless air of bureaucratic stagnation becomes oppressive even for the audience, making it easy to identify with Viviane's growing hunger for freedom.
fresh	What does a gal have to do to obtain a divorce (a gett) from an Orthodox Jewish man? Quite a lot as this fascinating courtroom drama indicates.
fresh	We see a woman imprisoned in her own marriage, and even though there is no direct reason why she needs the divorce, she is unable to have her own goals realized.
fresh	There might not be that much insight, but there certainly is plenty of geriatric spunk.
fresh	"Iris" is the cinematic equivalent of a party, with its titular character as its host. There are plenty of interesting people in attendance, but she's the real star, and less than 90 minutes, we wish the celebration would have gone on just a bit longer.
fresh	Apfel is constantly chatting to "Albert" off camera, not to us, and the affection adds an unusual meta level to Iris ... That intimacy is the movie's real subject; it'll make you feel swaddled in stylish conspiracy.
fresh	Much like Elaine Stritch, who also wore the same signature owl eyeglasses, Iris Apfel is a New York City character, a grande dame of society, fashion and flea markets.
fresh	Iris's offhand irreverence is left unexplained. But the joy of Iris Apfel, and by extension of Iris, is that there's no need to dissect the enigma.
fresh	Maysles is clearly entranced by his subject, and all of the big names he interviews - including photographer Bruce Weber, designer Dries van Noten and Architectural Digest Editor-in-Chief Margaret Russell - are similarly smitten.
fresh	Maysles' portrait of Iris Apfel, a 93-year-old self-described "geriatric starlet," is surprisingly memorable, graced with an unforced but unmistakable charm.
fresh	When she says "It's better to be happy than well-dressed," there are a lot of folks you hope get the message.
fresh	Traveling to vintage clothing stores from W. 27th St. to Palm Beach, Fla., Apfel creates excursions that are like time spent with your coolest, funniest and most sage aunt. Her energy and life philosophy are inspiring, and will never go out of style.
fresh	Iris never feigns importance as a documentary, and is all the richer for it.
fresh	Maysles was undoubtedly the ideal cameraman to enter Iris' life and simply observe her non-stop activity, and his visual eloquence is an understated but constant asset to "Iris."
fresh	There are few better ways right now to spend 80 movie minutes than to see Iris, a delightful eye-opener about life, love, statement eyeglasses, bracelets the size of tricycle tires and the art of making the grandest of entrances.
fresh	With Iris, the late, great documentarian Albert Maysles, who died this year at age 88, delivers a particularly elegiac movie swan song.
fresh	The film exists as a document both of a witty, good-natured society fixture and of a very particular moment in history.
fresh	Viewer entertainment will vary in direct proportion to interest in the unusual but ultimately mundane details of Apfel's day-to-day. She is, for what it's worth, good company.
fresh	Iris is more than just a movie about an amusing lady who likes clothes an awful lot. It's also a celebration of the revivifying power of creativity ...
fresh	Iris isn't groundbreaking doc filmmaking, but it's amiable and jovial in a way rarely seen in the field, which tends more toward drama, trauma, and forwarding big causes.
fresh	Knowing Albert Maysles made the film already gives it instant credibility, but Iris' flamboyant personality is animated enough to make the film sweet, enchanting, and quite lovable.
fresh	A singular eccentric and fashion icon gets a nice "direct cinema" documentary profile by the late Albert Maysles.
fresh	Maysles endearingly reveals Apfel's blend of blind passion and keen practicality, her unflagging enthusiasm for transmitting her knowledge to young people, and her synoptic view of fashion as living history.
fresh	Albert Maysles's portrait of Iris Apfel gradually emerges with cathartic clarity without compromising her inherent mystery.
fresh	An admiring and amusing documentary.
fresh	Iris is a fond portrait of a personality who could easily be regarded as a freakshow. Better, though, to say that she's an entertainer.
fresh	Daffy, brassy, inspiring, and a bit slight.
fresh	An interest in fashion is not required to enjoy and admire this truly original character.
fresh	Warmly reveals Iris Apfel is more than her owlish glasses. . .Followed for a year+. . . Maysles's legendary cinema verite technique is most effective at watching her shop.
fresh	Predictable but the cast succeeds on making the best of the script.
rotten	"A la Mala" falls on the same superficiality that it tries to make fun of.
fresh	The Mexican Rom/com "A La Mala" is predictable but is also a good time at the movies.
fresh	Perhaps because it's in Spanish, or perhaps because of Derbez' charisma, it generates enough charm and goodwill -- if not exactly laughs -- to ride pleasantly off into the sunset.
rotten	A la Mala coasts on its style and charm, and that may be enough for this kind of romp... Nevertheless, a bit more originality in the script by Issa Lopez and Ari Rosen would be a welcome diversion.
rotten	Cute, pretty, but alas not "mala" (cruel) enough.
fresh	Hyena's convoluted tale is given a fresh coat of grime by Johnson's direction, which favors handheld cinematography -- often tracking its protagonists from behind -- that gives the action a pseudo-verite ruggedness.
rotten	I suspect that anyone who actually makes it to the bitter end will be enraged by what it does and does not contain.
fresh	"Hyena" feels like a throwback to the tough-as-nails British gangster flicks of the 1970s.
rotten	The kind of gory British policier from which you come away with the queasy feeling that the world is essentially a butcher shop ruled by greed, murder, cruelty and lust.
rotten	Johnson aspires to make Hyena into the stuff of classical tragedy, yet he telegraphs Michael's inward transformation way too soon.
fresh	At its most palatable the film recalls "The Long Good Friday"; at its harshest, it's a grotty cousin to "The Bad Lieutenant." There's enough filmmaking intelligence to guide "Hyena" through its worst excesses, however.
fresh	Mr. Johnson isn't out just for blood, or sociology, but the clever hybrid he creates is wholly entertaining.
fresh	While the movie keeps tightening the noose around Logan's neck, any interest in whether he'll manage to escape being arrested or killed is largely academic.
fresh	Beautifully shot, feverishly edited and also benefiting from the right score and authentic locations, Hyena is that kind of ugly film that refuses to let you turn away.
fresh	A pretty sensational and tough British crime drama. A real gem, and visually stunning to boot.
fresh	As stylish, scorched-earth entertainment, it'll get you in its teeth.
fresh	It's a film about the lawless and unruly, but it could stand to step outside the lines a bit.
rotten	The Gerard Johnson film's blanket cynicism is its most shopworn quality of all.
rotten	Trying to hybridize thick-ear genre material with more artistically ambitious fare, the results are too leaden for the Jason Statham crowd but insufficiently distinctive to find a more rarefied niche.
fresh	Some crime sagas only give London's underbelly a tickle. Hyena scratches 'til it bleeds.
fresh	It's well performed and seedily atmospheric but there's no one to root for and the story, like the characters, becomes a bit hysterical.
fresh	Johnson's filmmaking, however, takes no such short cuts, with sound, image and editing colluding to keep Hyena in a perpetual state of agitated panic. Technique often excitingly thwarts our genre expectations.
fresh	In many respects, it operates like a sobering counterpoint to the early Noughties Brit crime flicks; but also the largely repugnant tranche of straight-to-video gangster films that propagate an especially brutal, geezerish type of violence.
fresh	Visually arresting and brutally slick, writer-director Gerard Johnson's second feature Hyena is a tough crime thriller that, while it may not be for the faint-hearted, is made with control and real skill.
rotten	The film never quite escapes the grip of the genre cliches with which it wrestles.
fresh	What lifts the film is Johnson's visual style and Ferdinando's utterly committed and intense performance as the corrupt cop.
fresh	There's something bullish and unrelenting about writer-director Gerard Johnson's filmmaking that sets this bleak drama apart.
fresh	Writer-director Gerard Johnson has a good eye and ear for sleaze and depravity, and I really do mean that as a compliment.
fresh	The picture's main asset is Ferdinando, who delivers a strong lead performance as the strung-out narc whose world is crumbling around him.
fresh	The ending is frustrating: it runs out of ideas before the final credits. But Johnson packs an almighty punch.
rotten	Hyena doesn't stint on creating a grubbily repellent universe, but it never gives us one solid reason to stick around.
fresh	Intoxicating, ferocious, and righteously disturbing but also frustrating, uneven and cliched.
fresh	Writer-director Gerard Johnson and chameleon-like star Ferdinando continue to impress with their strong collaboration here.
fresh	The most powerful British crime flick since 'Sexy Beast'.
fresh	Scratchy and savage, Hyena is long on squalor and short on polish, but made with genuine conviction.
fresh	"Hyena" may not be wholly original, but its cancerous tenor positions many of its various talents as ones to watch.
rotten	Ferdinando's Michael Logan was never going to rival Ryan Gosling's Driver or Kim Bodnia's Frank, but the comparisons to both Drive and the Pusher trilogy are inescapable.
rotten	A compelling central performance from Peter Ferdinando is not enough to save Gerard Johnson's derivative and deeply unpleasant thriller, Hyena.
fresh	A strong enough thriller for an audience with the stomach for very black humour and severely testing imagery.
rotten	Adventure fails to permeate the listlessness of this overlong, self-indulgent would-be thriller.
fresh	"How do middle-class people like us stand up for our country?" Byomkesh asks Ajit. The teasing answer: "We don't. We go to the movies."
fresh	An important film to see for parents, students and anyone involved with academia.
fresh	Important but devastating viewing.
fresh	When and where your frustration and anger boil over while watching "The Hunting Ground" is an individual experience, one that will be different for everyone who sees it.
fresh	Perhaps "The Hunting Ground" is more valued as activism than journalism.
fresh	Too few women (and men) have too little chance to share their stories. Dick's film is a valuable spotlight.
fresh	The Hunting Ground qualifies as activist filmmaking. More power to it. You can read all the statistics you want, but there's no substitute for bearing witness - especially in such overwhelming numbers.
fresh	Oversimpliies matters somewhat, but...the subject is an extremely timely one, and it presents an extremely important side of it quite persuasively.
fresh	This is a story to make blood boil and change demanded.
fresh	Provocative and heartbreaking.
fresh	The Hunting Ground is a clear piece of survivors' advocacy. Dick's purpose is not to be fair to both sides. But is that such a problem when no one has been fair to his subjects?
fresh	The Hunting Ground is, by its very nature, rough going for the viewer, but how else should it be?
fresh	The Hunting Ground finds a narrative spine in the story of two rape victims: Andrea Pino and Annie E. Clark, students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wound up launching their own grassroots investigation into the epidemic.
fresh	For many, going to college is a dream come true. Sadly, as this film points out, it will also become a nightmare.
fresh	We are way past the time for pandering. Colleges and their administrations must be held accountable. No longer should even one victim of sexual assault be treated in the manner evidenced here.
fresh	Its message of hope is heartening. Yet, after watching this expertly constructed film, it's hard to shake a lingering feeling of despair that any forthcoming change may only be temporary.
fresh	The film uses those pesky things known as facts -- statistics and reports and anecdotal evidence -- to argue with thoroughly convincing precision that this is an epidemic.
fresh	The documentary makes a persuasive case that certain colleges and universities -- which are called out onscreen -- foster a culture that punishes victims and protects serial predators.
fresh	The most disturbing part of Hunting Ground is the circling-wagons mentality of universities and colleges.
fresh	From its first moments, the new documentary "The Hunting Ground" instills a sense of dread that is very, very tough to shake.
fresh	Ensures that no one can foolishly attribute this problem to a particular kind of person or institution.
fresh	Grim docu shines much-needed light on campus rape epidemic.
fresh	The Hunting Ground directly and, at times, bluntly argues its case, appealing directly to the audiences' sense of moral outrage.
fresh	Though far from a perfect film, The Hunting Ground is a significant piece of advocacy journalism that shows young women refusing to be mute about crimes that have been commited against them.
fresh	"&#8202;'71" succeeds as an action thriller, but with enough complexity to keep the brain engaged. The film is also a reminder of the byproducts of hatred.
rotten	As a call to action, "The Hunting Ground" truly goes to bat for rape survivors. As a documentary, the movie as a whole is much lesser than its individual parts.
fresh	The movie needs to be seen and discussed by everyone within shouting distance of the college experience: parents, students (of both genders), administrators, alumni, coaches - the list goes on.
fresh	The Hunting Ground explores its disturbing subject so thoroughly that the documentary feels more like a horror film - a slasher movie where the psyches of its young, smart victims are in tatters.
fresh	The Hunting Ground's most unsettling finding is widespread institutional tolerance of campus rapists, because school administrators fear bad publicity and the loss of alumni cash endowments.
fresh	It's uncomfortable viewing. But scrupulously researched and movingly told.
fresh	Dick turns his camera closer to home in The Hunting Ground, revealing a culture in U.S. universities that, if it doesn't actually foster sex crimes, does little to bring perpetrators to justice.
fresh	While the nauseating statistics about rape and sexual abuse are prominent in the film, it is the dedication of the growing numbers of victims coming forth that will cause change.
rotten	There's a dicey feeling of familiarity to Dick's new film, a sense of footage fitting into pre-existing slots ... Instead of putting a human face on appalling statistics, the faces are starting to look like just more quantifiable evidence
fresh	The filmmakers build a strong and comprehensive case in a movie that offers an essential grounding in one of the defining issues of our time.
fresh	The film stokes outrage, sometimes shamelessly, but it's righteous outrage.
fresh	Indignant and impassioned, mostly manages to get behind the headlines and ahead of the news on the issue of sexual assaults on campuses, but lacks clear legal context.
fresh	Diligently researched, The Hunting Ground is infuriating and dispiriting, but it does offer a muted ray of hope in Andrea Pino and Annie Clark.
rotten	By refusing to engage the current conversation about this issue, the film does its subjects-and us all-a disservice.
fresh	"A timely, thorough and truly inspiring documentary about the financial and marketing imperatives that lead academic institutions to deny their students safety and justice."
fresh	I was rattled watching it, finding it hard to catch my breath and harder still to imagine how many people are in positions of power who have heard these stories so many times and turned their backs on victims.
fresh	Fear of retaliation often keeps faculty and administration from speaking up for students or talking at all ... If it does nothing else, "The Hunting Ground" should make that kind of evasion more difficult in the future.
fresh	Documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick takes on the incendiary topic of rape on campus. As the cases mount and institutional reps succeed best by playing dumb, The Hunting Ground becomes an energizing call to action.
fresh	The stories are horrifying, but essential to hear.
fresh	'The Hunting Ground' captures a movement whose time may have come and is long overdue.
fresh	A hard-hitting and disturbing documentary about the treatment of women who have been sexually assaulted on U. S. College campuses.
fresh	It's a strong and stirring film.
fresh	A must-watch work of cine-activism, one that should be seen by anyone headed to college and by those already on campus.
fresh	The Hunting Ground isn't necessarily a great film-but it doesn't need to be to work as powerful advocacy.
fresh	The result is a shocking but ultimately galvanizing work of reportage that meets the same high standard of their previous collaboration, The Invisible War, about sexual assault in the military.
fresh	It will be fascinating to watch the fallout from this scathing indictment of a system that, the movie claims, has all but encouraged sexual predators to do their worst.
fresh	Heartbreaking, infuriating, and unmissable.
fresh	Didn't have to do much more than wrangle attention towards an important issue, but it does slightly more than that.
rotten	The subject matter may not lend itself to an overtly ambitious aesthetic, but a film about individuals who refuse to be silenced could stand to take a few more chances itself.
fresh	This documentary about the epidemic of rape on college campuses is a difficult but worthy watch.
fresh	Shocks and awakens its audience in all the right ways, bringing the recent headlines of a Columbia University rape survivor carrying her mattress around into sharp focus.
fresh	Kirby Dick's films don't go far enough in explaining how a culture of rape can pervade in vastly different institutions, but they're ruthless about holding them accountable.
fresh	A startling doc about college rape that is torn from today's headlines.
fresh	This film provides a platform for these survivors to put their name and face out there; to de-stigmatize what it is to live with sexual trauma, and humanize the difficult, uneven path of survivorship.
rotten	... the emotional weight is again there for an effective issue film, but it's difficult to recommend on that alone when the style and structure of the doc is so standard and sometimes just plain sloppy.
fresh	While the film volleys disturbing statistics throughout, The Hunting Ground keeps the focus exactly where it should be: on the survivors.
fresh	The filmmaking may not be noteworthy, but it is the stories that are both illuminating and essential and will likely not leave a dry eye in the audience.
fresh	The Hunting Ground takes a somber tone, and delivers alarming testimony and statistics.
fresh	Kirby Dick's gripping follow-up to the 'The Invisible War' investigates sexual assault on college campuses.
rotten	At least the three affable stars have an infectious enthusiasm, but that chemistry only goes so far when it's so difficult to find much sympathy for these bumbling losers.
rotten	The problem is that this movie shares screen-time with a mid-2000s shock comedy. Hardly five minutes go by without something gross or disgusting happening.
rotten	You'll just be rooting for the credits to roll.
rotten	The movie gets dumber and more desperate as it goes.
rotten	It seems to have been designed as a family guy's workplace comedy on tour with the boys, a kind of EuroBusinessTrip with a heart: it fails dismally on all counts.
rotten	Comedies this toothless and safe are a dime a dozen...
rotten	The crude humor and cloying sentiment mix about as well as motor oil and vinegar...
rotten	"Unfinished Business" is sloppy, tiresome, poorly constructed and ultimately awful.
rotten	The movie had a chance to be better, but when the subject turns to something as timely as school bullying, it barely scratches the surface.
rotten	Jesus wept, Vince Vaughn has done it again - kicking the putrefying corpse of feel-bad scrotal comedy around our screens with the dead-eyed stare of the fiscally medicated.
rotten	Little contained in this misfire of a film works and the few successful things are dragged out to the point where they die a lingering death.
rotten	Watching a fumbling comedy flop isn't fun....
rotten	Vince Vaughn's usual motormouth appeal gets stuck in first gear in a muddled, patchy business comedy.
rotten	A hard-R comedy that at least makes an attempt to present us with real people rather than just receptacles for dick-and-puke jokes.
rotten	A would-be comedy of embarrassment that is simply embarrassing.
rotten	Shallow, dimwitted and inept. Makes "The Hangover" look like "Glengarry Glen Ross."
rotten	Jammed between pratfalls that include a man's face and a penis coming together is a sentimental story about the challenges of being a good, supportive dad. The movie wants you to hug your family - but wait, whoa, look at those tatas!
rotten	If I could have endured this film over a conference call it would have been preferable.
rotten	Unfinished Business is a perfect storm of unfocused - mostly unfunny - mundane comedic filmmaking.
rotten	...stiff and unfocused and strained for any kind of credibility or realism...
rotten	There are more penises on display in Unfinished Business than there were in Fifty Shades of Grey. Just let that sink in for a minute...
fresh	The three leads balance each other especially well: Vaughn's ironic vulnerability and Wilkinson's pained earnestness set off Franco's shy optimism.
fresh	Unfinished Business may be the best Judd Apatow comedy that Judd Apatow never made.
rotten	A tonal mess that jumbles elements of PG-rated fare with Eurotrip-esque shenanigans.
rotten	It starts with vague promise but rapidly degenerates into a puerile mess, flailing for laughs like a ten-year-old class clown desperate for popularity.
fresh	Not without charm, Unfinished Business mixes the cute with the raunchy.
rotten	"Unfinished Business" is a major let-down and proof that even someone of Vince Vaughn's ability and stature needs help behind the camera to make us love him again.
rotten	Going through the motions and never uncovering any funny material to play with, "Unfinished Business" is just that: a film that had loads of potential but isn't able to muster any laughs with it.
rotten	A wacky, hijinxy, dick joke-filled sex romp that inadvisably keeps trying to be touching.
fresh	There's plenty to like in Unfinished Business, even though viewers expecting the debauchery of a Wedding Crashers will likely leave disappointed.
rotten	Crass, inconsistent comedy has lots of sex, partying.
fresh	But I can't bring myself to hate Unfinished Business as it gives Vaughn, Franco et al. juuuuust enough funny stuff to do while being agreeably mediocre; it'd be like kicking a dog for its failure to be a cat.
rotten	Unfinished Business has a big heart, a tiny brain and a lot of bad attitude. That turns it into a murky mess as a movie.
rotten	A comedy is supposed to have jokes. This one just has ideas for them.
rotten	Painfully, and desperately unfunny. Which, for a film in the comedy genre, proves to be something of a problem.
rotten	The film limps along, with no sense of comic timing, slapstick reality, or even spontaneity. It's so airless, and yet it feels heavy as lead.
fresh	Rude, crude but often delightful and fresh business farce.
rotten	Truly abysmal - Vaughn's shtick has reached the breaking point.
rotten	The film's biggest issue is its awkward lurching back and forth between the goofy and/or risque material and more serious issues. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Unfinished Business is strained, unnecessarily crude and downright bizarre in spots. Yet you'll laugh just enough at Team Vince Vaughn to forgive and (mostly) forget.
rotten	I guess they call it Unfinished Business because they meant to put in all of the jokes later, but forgot?
rotten	Apparently made by snickering 12-year-olds who like naked boobies and have heard rumors about the phenomenon known as 'the business trip.'
rotten	The problem with "Unfinished Business" is not that it is outright terrible, but that it is so terminally bland.
rotten	Too crude to be taken seriously and too family-focused to be a guilty pleasure, this is one company retreat you'll want to skip.
rotten	Unfinished Business means well, but it doesn't work well.
rotten	Vince Vaughn, continuing his decade-long streak of mediocre comedies plays another variation on his fast-talking, slightly oafish but goodhearted regular guy.
rotten	One can see it on the actors' faces: This was a mistake.
rotten	The odd juvenile chuckle that results from this may sustain you, but in terms of originality and heart this business trip fails to seal the deal.
rotten	The whole point of Vince Vaughn's cinematic existence is that he's a paragon for reformed chauvinism. He's an irrepressible but highly tamable id. Not so here.
rotten	Don't expect impressive profit margins.
fresh	There's enough big laughs combined with sweet family drama to make Unfinished Business an eventful journey.
rotten	A sluggishly paced collection of go-nowhere sight gags, flat-footed set pieces and incoherent business chatter that offers few laughs and little real payoff.
rotten	Vince Vaughn would make an excellent Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman. Here, he has the presence, charm, desperation and sense of yearning that characterise Arthur Miller's doomed anti-hero. Unfortunately, this is a very goofy comedy.
rotten	If only I could have left Unfinished Business unfinished... Five minutes would have been enough with this dull, dated tosh, so flaccid were the jokes.
rotten	Scott's direction seems to suffer from ADHD - most of the flair-free gags are rushed and little or no momentum is allowed to build up before we're on to the next malfunctioning comedy re-run.
rotten	A weird and sadly sour mash-up of wild, raunchy comedy, underdog triumph, and treacly family story
rotten	This is a movie that treats everyone like grey specters in a faceless corporation. Not that you would expect much else from a movie that openly admits its premise is boring.
rotten	Now where have we seen this before? Was it "Jerry Maguire?" Or an episode of "The Office?" Both. Except it was funnier then.
rotten	A fumbling mix of sentimental family fable and gross-out sex comedy.
fresh	This hybrid vehicle may take a unwise detour here and there - even hitting a mud-filled pothole or two - but in the end you just might find that it's been an entertaining ride.
rotten	Gay panic humor, jokes about German liberation, random business dicks, and the most un-earned sentimental ending imaginable lead to a film that just doesn't work out.
rotten	Criminally fails to take advantage of its vast comedic cast as they flounder in a sea of crude, dull gags
rotten	No better or worse than indifferent, although its targeting of the German capital for fratboy profiteering suggests some renegotiation of the Marshall Plan may now be necessary.
rotten	A lazy film that contains more than a few lazy laughs but will ultimately only amuse those thrilled by boobs staring at breasts...
rotten	If Unfinished Business represents Vaughn's desperate attempt to run whatever's left of his career into the toilet, then we can safely say that he's indeed finished.
rotten	"Unfinished Business" squanders almost every opportunity provided by its potentially funny premise. Instead, it becomes yet another blotch on star Vince Vaughn's resume.
rotten	That "Unfinished Business" thinks it's a really fun idea to have a leading character named Mike Pancake tells you all you need to know.
rotten	When Unfinished Business loses itself to its own madness, there is the sense that its inherent weirdness is on the verge of coalescing into something big, brilliant and spectacular. But that never happens.
rotten	The role is a departure of sorts for Vaughn, his character more responsible than the goofballs he normally plays, but his frat-boy shtick has grown the worse for wear since the days of Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers.
rotten	Overall, the screenplay by Steve Conrad feels confused and sits uncomfortably between genres, causing the film to fall completely flat on its face.
rotten	This is one mess of a movie with just enough lowbrow laughs to stave off the narrative malaise threatening to freeze the story.
rotten	Certainly has the potential to tear through madcap Euro-based misadventures, but it would rather stick to sobering reminders of real-world behavior, draining most of the fun out of a feature that aims to please.
rotten	This film is just bad Business for everyone involved.
rotten	At times so shoddily made you'd swear it was actually unfinished, the charm of Vaughn, Franco, Nick Frost and the rest can't compensate for a shocking lack of jokes.
rotten	It's as if someone decided to film a standard Hangover knock-off script as the kind of painfully sincere, dour exploration of shattered dreams and squandered expectations.
rotten	A thin, tone deaf and seriously unfunny comedy.
rotten	What are we to say about a comedy that makes you walk out feeling lousy, that's like a parade of beaten virtue and (mostly) sadistic power?
rotten	Like several of Vaughn's most recent comedies, this one concerns itself with keeping its heart in the "right" place-i.e., a safe distance from the unsavory business of laughter.
rotten	A sort of unfinished idea that could have been interesting, could have been funny, could have been something other than the jumbled mess that it is.
rotten	More than just a misfire, this attempt at a rude comedy goes so spectacularly wrong that it actually contradicts its own jokes even as it's telling them.
rotten	Lazy, saccharine and (worst of all) safe, Unfinished Business is a stock image photo of what a raunchy road trip comedy is supposed to look like.
rotten	The True Detective-inspired Vaughnaissance can't get here fast enough.
rotten	Unfinished Business certainly lives up to the promise of its title: the film looks as though it needs another six months' work.
rotten	You can see the fear in Vaughn's eyes as another gag limps to its payoff, another scene fails to deliver anything but stony silence where the laugh is supposed to be.
fresh	Packed with montages and non-sequiturs, this is a weird-ass business comedy that still manages to pack a tiny emotional sucker punch in the end.
rotten	The fact that it can't spell out the basics of this business deal - outside of some "robble robble projected income graph percentage closing" jargon - is indicative of a general lack of focus and an inconsistency in tone.
rotten	The supporting cast takes some of the comic weight off the always likeable Vaughn's shoulders. But Wilkinson's character is too sad-sack to be really funny and Franco's verges on the mawkish.
rotten	Unfinished Business will seem woefully familiar to most anyone who's been to a movie theater - or taken a long plane ride - over the past 10 years.
rotten	Awkwardly wrapping a heartwarming message of self-acceptance in a layer of crude sexual humor, it's like a date who tries to pat you on the back with one hand while feeling you up with the other.
fresh	Suspenseful with moving performances, but suffers from a pedestrian, Hollywood-style screenplay and brisk pacing that doesn't give the film enough room to breathe nor does it trust your patience.
fresh	...a powerful family drama that has marked political and social overtones.
fresh	A real-life "Taken." Tremendously gripping Paris police procedural.
fresh	Told from Ruth's POV, the movie is nonetheless a tense police procedural as we keep company with the Halimi family undergoing confusion, fear, rage, hope and ultimately grief.
fresh	[It] has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as it's based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France today.
fresh	Knowing the outcome behind the true-life tragedy "24 Days" doesn't diffuse the horror, the tension or the sadness of watching one family's drama unfold day after agonizing day when a son is kidnapped and hope dies.
fresh	24 Days takes strength from real-world specifics. But the most powerful thing about the movie is its rejection of omniscience. The crime it reconstructs is beyond understanding.
rotten	Sadly, "24 Days" isn't nearly as involving as it should be.
fresh	As a suspenseful true crime story, "24 Days" succeeds. As a warning against the ever present dangers of anti-Semitism, it is eloquent and disturbing. It's in combining the two that Arcady mishandles the case.
fresh	A suspenseful and compelling film that's all the more powerful because it doesn't shy away from contemporary anti-Semitism in France.
rotten	Despite strenuous efforts, 24 Days fails to make the case that Halimi would be alive now had the anti-Semitism of his abductors been properly recognized.
fresh	Its ending known beforehand, the story nevertheless unfolds as a suspenseful thriller rather than docudrama, much of the credit for which goes to Manu de Sousa's jumpy editing.
fresh	24 Days is neither subtle nor particularly sophisticated as filmmaking, but its refusal to reduce lived reality to generic tropes is admirable.
rotten	Would that the film had explored such emotional contradictions in greater detail, but this retelling is more concerned with black-and-white morality, which drains it of suspense.
rotten	Slack, lacks the urgency that you expect a kidnapping thriller to have.
fresh	Alexandre Arcady's film is wrenching and politically astute.
fresh	The film is not always subtle... but remains captivating as a pure procedural that raises questions about the Paris police's handling of such situations, as well as about the state of race relations in contemporary France.
fresh	looks at many connected issues including immigration policies, anti-Semitism, class, and police competency and prejudice
fresh	About Elly is an exploration of human nature and how sometimes, without intending to, we hurt the ones we love most - including ourselves.
fresh	This is the fourth of [Farhadi's] six movies, and by this point he's begun to perfect the art of withholding and is close to mastering emotional suspense.
rotten	This pot-boiler takes the viewer by surprise after a slow start, but the start is too long and the surprise too short.
fresh	The dense interweave of relationships, a Farhadi specialty, is continually compelling.
fresh	It's breezy, then suspenseful, and gradually, crushingly sad. On its own terms, it's a perfect film.
fresh	"About Elly" is an essential step in the evolution of one of the most emerging talents on the international filmmaking scene.
fresh	It has taken six years for this terrific film to work its way back to us, and if possible I think it's even better and more relevant in 2015 than when it was made.
fresh	We might not care about any of the characters -- it's doubtful that Farhadi wants us to -- but it's difficult to escape the implication that their situation reflects that of their entire society and, in many ways, our own.
fresh	"About Elly" shows that the ethical dilemmas of ordinary adults can, with this level of talent, become as gripping as any thriller.
fresh	A thriller perched right on the fault line between modern thinking and Islamic tradition.
fresh	As with director Asghar Farhadi's Oscar-winning "A Separation," this new film lets truth slowly be revealed through mystery - and after a shocking incident.
fresh	It's further confirmation of Farhadi's peerless skills as a dramatist, with a special talent for drawing prismatic meaning from simple premises.
fresh	This is clearly the work of a master in the making, an artist on the cusp of greatness. Farhadi may be fixated on fibbers, but there's almost no one working today who makes films so emotionally honest.
fresh	Its belated appearance should be welcomed by cinephiles, as it offers solid proof of this writer-director's distinctive gifts.
fresh	If it can be a touch too narratively byzantine and heavy-handed, it's still a quietly devastating throwback to the classics of drama.
fresh	There is a mastery of tone here that shows a great director completely at home with his characters.
fresh	You begin to wonder to what extent the film is a critique of an entire society in which the disparity between tradition and modernity is irreconcilable.
fresh	A drama about guilt and responsibility set against the backdrop of male domination in Iranian society that even affects the secular and well-educated milieu depicted in this gripping drama.
fresh	This superb, suspenseful film ... opens as a playful comedy of vacationing couples and awkward romance, one that might be set in the French countryside, but by the end has become a moral drama likely to corrode your certainties.
fresh	Rarely have layers of truth been so expertly peeled away than in About Elly, a drama from the Oscar-winning director of A Separation.
fresh	About Elly confirms director Asghar Farhadi as a major talent in Iranian cinema whose ability to chronicle the middle-class malaise of his society is practically unrivaled.
fresh	"About Elly" both clutches us tight and shuts us out, adding wave upon wave of secrets and lies.
fresh	Asghar Farhadi's sensibility embodies a combination of empathy and paranoia that's striking considering that the latter is normally driven by self-absorption.
fresh	A naturalistic story that turns into an attention-grabbing psychological thriller as friend blames friend for the death of a fellow vacationer.
fresh	Farhadi's expert at foreboding; these vacationers' sheer exultation is soon limned by a sense of life as coming tragedy, its sure and steady sadness rolling in like the surf.
fresh	The early singing and charades sequences go on a bit too long, but from the moment there is an incident on the beach, you'll be concerned for everyone involved.
fresh	Superbly acted, morally challenging, packed with legitimate suspense, this is film-making of a high order.
fresh	Farhadi confirms his masterly way with heartrending human dramas.
fresh	Once again, Farhadi has told an ordinary story in an extraordinary way.
fresh	A remarkable film that deserves as much acclaim as Farhadi's award-winner.
fresh	Really it's a picture of loneliness, in a land where speaking together in honesty and sharing the cries of the heart are things you do only in a crisis or an emergency.
fresh	A fascinating psychological drama.
fresh	Farhadi's films are like moral whodunits, and as Sepideh and her friends gradually unearth the truth, he expertly buffets our sympathies in all directions until the very last shot.
fresh	Incredibly gripping and brilliantly directed, About Elly is a truly memorable and emotionally engaging Iranian drama with an outstanding lead performance by Golshifteh Farahani.
fresh	Bursting with energy, this ensemble drama from Iran is raucous, chaotic and packed with strong emotion
fresh	The film's escalating energy, hysteria even, and moral debates will invite comparisons to the hothouse drama of 'A Separation'.
fresh	Farhadi's gifted storytelling and direction is on show again in a damning look at Iranian society.
fresh	Another shrewdly gauged study of our capacity for deception and self-deception from A Separation's auteur. Emotionally devastating.
fresh	Farhadi constructs a taut story, as precariously balanced on luck and lies as that of a French farce, and then lets it spring holes before our eyes.
fresh	One of the most remarkable Iranian films to surface in the last few years, About Elly is a small but compelling ensemble piece of surprising depth.
fresh	While not equaling the depth of characterization of Farhadi's previous films, About Elly takes the complexity of his storytelling to a fascinating level. However, the variable quality of the thesping also prevents the pic from being his best work.
fresh	The film's tone is primarily, even exclusively, reflective; observing human behavior simply because humans are interesting.
fresh	By allowing a slow-build to his drama, Asghar Farhadi ensures we get a feel for the extended family dynamic before wrong-footing the characters and his audience with the suddeness and deftness of a heartbeat.
fresh	Part historical drama and part action thriller, '71 makes for gripping viewing.
fresh	While the film benefits greatly from having such a reliable performer, it doesn't live and breathe by his performance, which only speaks to the intensity of the filmmaking.
fresh	In his harrowing debut, Demange transforms quaint hamlets into nightmare labyrinths and supercharges the suspense with a premise as minimal as it is electrifying-a man running for his life.
fresh	Takes the simple 'behind enemy lines' concept and turns it into something that resonates strongly within the historical context of the political instability of The Troubles
fresh	Jack O'Connell is our current saint of cinema suffering.
fresh	Everyone has a least favorite bad dream, and Hook's may be yours: the nightmare of being hopelessly lost in a place where time has stopped and hope has vanished.
fresh	Gregory Burke's script makes enough order out of the chaos to bring home the point that armed conflicts are never as simple as official reports and soothing government press releases would have us believe, especially when religious rivalry is in play.
fresh	O'Connell gives a compelling performance and the film, even when the details are confusing, is never less than gripping and, in its depiction of internecine warfare, tragic.
fresh	Even if you're a total newcomer to the subject matter, "'71" is a first-rate thriller that I highly recommend.
fresh	A superb debut feature from director Yann Demange, who expertly captures the mood of ragged violence and the naivety of British forces arriving in the midst of a deeply complex political conflict.
rotten	Never quite comes together as a compelling whole.
fresh	Exciting and very effective war thriller set during "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland. More thriller than political, but very well done.
fresh	The unconventional thriller is nearly as full of disillusionment as it is tension and suspense.
fresh	Outstanding, tense, nail-biting thriller set in the cauldron of violence and deprivation that was Belfast in 1971...director Yann Demange stages some vivid sequences and knows how to escalate tension to breaking point.
fresh	For those who know nothing of this bitter conflict, the movie is a good start.
fresh	Demange keeps the tension high throughout nearly the entire film.
fresh	'71 is more about its dark, brooding atmosphere, its high tension and memorable images, rather than posturing as a detailed character study or a history book.
fresh	As with most first-class war movies, '71 is undeniably anti-war.
fresh	'71 isn't trying to impress anyone with its action violence, and that's an incredible quality.
fresh	'71 lacks the easy payoffs on many war films, but it's all the more absorbing for that.
fresh	Lean, mean...Director Yann Demange and screenwriter Gregory Burke (the prominent Scottish playwright of Black Watch) twist the knife by serving Gary with constant reminders of boyish innocence corrupted...
fresh	The film doesn't take sides, but shows how conflict stirs the pot of human emotions and how quickly things can get out of control. And it shows that in war, no one is right.
fresh	Demange's feature debut miraculously distills the often Byzantine nature of the power politics behind The Troubles in a deeply intimate chamber piece about a single day in the life of a British soldier.
fresh	People died, but it's more than the bombs, bullets and bodies. The more fascinating damage was done to psyches and souls, and Demange, with '71, comes for yours.
fresh	The movie excites, but intelligently, without stoking blood lust or Old Testament revenge impulses.
rotten	If you are in the mood for a confusing and thoroughly depressing immersion into Irish history, you can't do better. But that would be a very odd mood to be in.
fresh	A "war is hell" movie that won't give up.
fresh	When it comes to vengeance and murderous intrigue, the Belfast in "&#8201;'71" is a small world.
fresh	O'Connell is terrific.
fresh	This isn't a story about religious differences. It's a thriller - gripping, almost abstract and carefully assembled by filmmakers who appear to know more about creating tension than explaining it.
fresh	It may not be fair to call Yann Demange a great filmmaker after just one feature, but that feature, '71, just might be a great film.
fresh	Scenes take on a surreal nightmare quality, sometimes with no accompanying sound, as even the camera seems dazed by what it is witnessing.
fresh	A deeply impressive thriller where the deeds are frightening yet the momentum is bracing.
fresh	The grainy, grimy, shadow-strewn look is right for this sort of military noir, and the women who haunt the edges of the conflict are splendid icons of both conscience and crushed humanity.
fresh	A terrific action movie that also says something painfully true about the deceit and double-dealing that poisoned peoples' lives during the years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
fresh	Shot by first-time feature director Yann Demange on the gritty streets of Sheffield and Liverpool in a style that puts the viewer in the crosshairs of the action, '71 is bracing from beginning to end.
fresh	"'71" is a well-crafted, tense film and an excellent debut for its authors.
fresh	A perfectly paranoiac score by David Holmes and downright stunning camerawork, courtesy of cinematographer Tat Radcliffe, enhance and embody Hook's manic flight.
fresh	This is a brisk, frightening movie about recent history and it's well worth a look.
fresh	It's a potent, visceral experience, but it doesn't offer much historical context, and its depiction of the IRA is fairly simplistic.
fresh	If you're looking for the top big screen debuts of the year, you'll find two straight off the bat in the nail-grinding thriller, '71.
fresh	It's a stylish, intense vehicle for rising star O'Connell, whose disillusionment is the emotional center of a movie that knows nobody gets out clean.
fresh	The best moments of '71 plop us in a scary situation, alive with the uncertainty of chaos as it happens.
fresh	Burke is interested in people not politics, keeping the focus on the sudden outbreaks of inhumanity and humanity in the madness, expertly crafting his thriller from the swirling fog of war.
fresh	It's a tense, introspective action movie, not the broad look at the geopolitical and on-the-ground realities that one might expect out of the sweeping title. And that's fine
fresh	Succeeds as a riveting historical drama that features winning performances and first-rate direction.
fresh	One of the early surprises of 2015, and hopefully will expand to more theaters and the wider audience it deserves.
fresh	Gripping, mournful, suspenseful.
fresh	It's only March, but this could be 2015's most invigorating directorial debut.
fresh	It's a master class in structure, a meticulously built period piece, a powerful anti-war film, and rarest of all, a thriller whose tension and suspense feel genuinely earned.
fresh	Such is the plot's momentum ... that we scarcely notice the jolts of implausibility.
fresh	It's a riveting, man-on-the-run genre movie, almost a combination of "Black Hawk Down" and "After Hours," rather than an allegory or a historical treatise.
fresh	... offers a powerfully immersive examination of morality and humanity inside a blue-collar war zone.
fresh	director Yann Demange and screenwriter Gregory Burke take a thoroughly new approach to look at the early days of Ireland's Troubles by casting an innocent in the garb of an invader into dangerous territory where allies may be enemies and enemies allies.
fresh	Within its limited compass, '71 packs a punch, and the lack of political bias does give it a more encompassing feel.
fresh	'71 doesn't always work, but when it does, it's a blistering, gripping tale of a boy lost in a war gone horribly wrong.
fresh	O'Connell continues to bring equal measures of toughness and vulnerability to his characters. Despite his good looks, there's an everyman's quality to him, which he uses to full effect in "'71."
fresh	A tense thriller from Britain that so adroitly joins physical intensity, emotional authenticity and political acuity that you may find yourself forgetting to take a breath.
fresh	Mr. O'Connell runs away with " '71," in which his character's every emotional, psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema.
fresh	'71 may not illuminate all that much, but it consistently electrifies.
fresh	A private in the British army finds himself stranded on the streets of Belfast in 1971. Demange's film, spiked by an all-stops-out O'Connell, makes politics unnervingly personal.
fresh	Big-screen storytelling stripped to its dramatic and visual essentials, and the result is nothing less than shattering.
fresh	Demange's feature synthesizes the speed and dynamism of early Kathryn Bigelow-directed films...
fresh	A supremely effective nail-biter, but its greatest value is a sense of you-are-there commotion, envisioning a time and place with a screen ferocity that leaves lasting marks.
fresh	'71 rarely stops for breath; the threat of sudden violence hangs over every mundane conversation, and Demange expertly sustains the tension, allowing anxiety to build, briefly ebb, and then build again, over and over.
fresh	Yann Demange tints the midnight alleys of Belfast like an Irish flag dragged through the mud: black skies, sickly green lamps, and the orange flames of torched cars.
fresh	Its pitilessness is matched only by its economy
fresh	Visceral, vivid...pulse-pounding.
fresh	"'71" is a claustrophobic experience, as gray and imposing as the film's muted color palette.
fresh	A tense and exciting action-drama about a young British soldier caught out of his depth on the mean streets of Belfast in Northern Ireland in the early years of the Troubles.
fresh	The Troubles have rarely been more troubling onscreen than they are in '71, a vivid, shivery survival thriller that turns the red-brick residential streets of Belfast into a war zone of unconscionable peril.
fresh	A big part of [Demange's] achievement resides in the casting of such a veteran crew of character actors in the first place, but credit is due for coaxing such subtle performances.
fresh	When the action slows down just enough for dialogue that extends beyond gruff, hollered exchanges, Gregory Burke's brilliantly economical screenplay doesn't mince words.
fresh	The tension this movie keeps going throughout its 99-minute runtime is nothing short of remarkable [...] There is not an ounce of fat [present].
fresh	Few movies show the rage between the British Unionists and the Irish Republican army as effectively as "'71."
fresh	A tense, nerve-racking drama set primarily over the course of one night in Belfast.
fresh	The movie is an affirmation of O'Connell's talent and an announcement of Demange's.
fresh	Remarkably even-handed amid the hyper-violence. An anti-war film that puts you off war by making it seem nightmarish and brutal.
fresh	Yann Demange's film most backgrounds the politics in favor of nervy suspense, you-are-there verisimilitude and strong characterizations.
fresh	A formidable debut for TV/commercial director Demange
fresh	It's beautifully shot, smartly written and packed with suspense. But Top Boy director Yann Demange and Black Watch writer Gregory Burke do slightly over-egg the plot.
fresh	With O'Connell's arresting lead performance backed by a gritty supporting cast, '71 marks an impressive feature debut from director Yann Demange, who uses jittery hand-held cameras to give the action cinema verite urgency and immediacy.
fresh	The mix of genre contrivances and docudrama can be queasy at times. You won't have a moment to dwell on such faults thanks to stealthy direction by newbie Demange, who keeps the action moving between scenes and standoffs that are lurid and visceral.
fresh	1971 was one of the worst years of The Troubles and many of us would be forgiven for not wishing to return to that very grim time in our recent history. However, '71 is a sensational watch, a must-see for film goers in Northern Ireland.
fresh	The film's more interested in the politics of war, rather than the specifics of the conflict; the idea, to paraphrase Richard Dormer's ex-army medic, that rich ****s use stupid ****s to kill poor ****s.
fresh	Demange and Burke jack up the tension by subverting the stranger-in-a-foreign-land aspect of the plot in ways that smartly and subtly tap into the specifics of the situation.
fresh	Having settled on Belfast, the film-makers revel in the artificial fibres, shaggy hair, and nicotine-yellow ceilings of a particular place at a particular time.
fresh	You can almost feel a trickle of sweat start to form as director Yann Demange and his crew evoke a nightmarish world in which trust is a luxury that only the foolish can afford.
fresh	'71 brings a fresh perspective and a piercing urgency to a well-worn scenario.
fresh	Yann Demange's brilliant debut feature is an honourable companion piece to Carol Reed's 1947 classic, Odd Man Out.
fresh	'71 gives us just enough background detail and hints about the complexities of the conflict while still keeping an eye on what is essentially a 'behind enemy lines' story.
fresh	For all its flaws '71 offers a lapel-grabbing, immersive viewing experience likely to shake up audiences who couldn't otherwise care less about the boredom-factor whys and wherefores of Northern Ireland's bitterest years.
fresh	Both an intensely personal odyssey and an exploration of the impact of conflict on communities, this sharply involving thriller marks an auspicious debut for director Yann Demange.
fresh	A blistering, disturbing portrayal of one British soldier's attempt to get back to his Belfast barracks after being stranded behind enemy lines during the Troubles.
fresh	An extraordinarily tense adventure story that recalls John Carpenter's Escape from New York as much as Paul Greengrass's Bloody Sunday.
fresh	'71 hurtles along, visceral and daring.
fresh	It's an extraordinary cinematic debut for director Yann Demange, whose unflinching lens quickly establishes an environment that seethes with danger and menace...
fresh	The villainy is, perhaps unavoidably, somewhat signposted, but this is a tense, gripping thriller that combines real-world relevance with high-concept entertainment. In a superb ensemble, O'Connell is outstanding.
fresh	Stumbles at the last, but this is strong work from Demange.
fresh	Demange has crafted a thoroughly convincing picture of 1970s Belfast (actually filmed in Blackburn and Liverpool) that could almost be a bleak newsreel from the era.
fresh	This is a taut thriller, with great control of action and pace, and an outstanding re-creation of the west Belfast war zone.
fresh	In revisiting the Troubles, what this film finds is a wasteland of shattered trust, and the only objective it comprehends is getting out alive.
fresh	Remember this name: Jack O'Connell. He is magnificent in one of the most remarkable portraits of soldiering in recent memory.
fresh	The film's mix of hard-nosed realist drama with more heightened genre elements - action, certainly; horror, even - means that it's always distinctive and has you in its grip from start to finish.
fresh	A brutal army thriller that feels like the truth, thanks to take-noprisoners storytelling and a tell-no-lies performance from Jack O'Connell, Brit-grit's heir apparent.
fresh	You're hooked to the very final frame.
fresh	O'Connell is an eloquent actor who can do more with less.
fresh	A riveting film about a British solder adrift in 1971 Belfast, a dangerous war zone filled with zealous partisans of all types.
rotten	...Demange's many, many attempts to generate tension fall completely and hopelessly flat.
fresh	It distinguishes itself from Pual Greengrass's films by virtue of its close attention to political and moral ambiguities.
fresh	A perfect historical thriller. Jack O'Connell is a future mega star.
fresh	This is confident, fascinating filmmaking.
fresh	The unconventional and multidirectional approach '71 takes in exploring a moment in history more than makes up for its mixed success as an action movie.
fresh	Don't expect the speeches or political bombast of 'Bloody Sunday.' Think of the survivalism of 'The Naked Prey.'
fresh	There's a fluidity to the way one small conflict bleeds into the next, with neither the main character nor us getting much of a chance to slow down and take a breath.
fresh	There is certainly enough about this young filmmaker to suggest a bright career beckons.
fresh	Don't Think I've Forgotten leaves the powerful impression of a music scene that took the shape of whatever cultural or political forces were imposed on it at the time.
fresh	As expressionistic as it is journalistic, Don't Think I've Forgotten triumphs as both an objective record and a poetic lament: It's a film that's every bit as entrancing and haunting as the lost music it celebrates.
fresh	The first two-thirds of Don't Think I've Forgotten is a pure and joyous celebration of the music. The last third is an avowal of just how potent rock 'n' roll can be.
fresh	...not only recovers important music but also examines the devastating toll that a violent international conflict takes on culture
fresh	Because it concentrates on the music - interviewing surviving fans and artists, generously sampling old 45s and video clips - "Don't Think I've Forgotten" offers a fresh and powerful account of Cambodia's painful history.
fresh	Artfully assembled, with interviews interspersed between period footage [...], Pirozzi's film makes the whole period come alive.
fresh	This is eye-opening and frequently moving, elevated by sharp editing that imaginatively juxtaposes major events in government and entertainment history.
fresh	"Don't Think I've Forgotten" reminds us of music's essential role as cultural unifier.
rotten	Despite its sense of mission, the film suffers from soapy excesses and narrative disjunctures.
fresh	Patrik-Ian Polk makes a huge artistic leap with this deeply affecting, funny and original peek at one confused youth's coming out process.
rotten	At no point does anyone in the film even vaguely resemble an actual 21st-century teenager; when these kids text each other, it comes across like science fiction.
fresh	A gospel-driven cross of Precious and Rent, only set in a sleepy Southern town that time forgot instead of New York City.
rotten	Director Patrik-Ian Polk makes the ending a little too pat, but he makes us root for these characters to be happy, and for their world to be a better place.
rotten	Anything that can go wrong, will - often in spectacular fashion.
rotten	The film is, like its main character, too naive to understand or, at least, to deploy the reparative powers of camp.
rotten	The story ends up being one wrong turn after another. A GPS hasn't been invented that could get this plot-hole-riddled script back on track.
rotten	There's a full tank of cliches for the mismatched-strangers road movie "Cas & Dylan," the feature directing debut of Jason Priestley, and the sputtering is cacophonous even with two gifted actors leading the way.
fresh	This Canadian movie, from a screenplay by Jessie Gabe, begins in Winnipeg and ends in Vancouver and jounces along on the crackle of smart-aleck dialogue mouthed by its stars, Richard Dreyfuss and Tatiana Maslany.
rotten	It is still hard to fathom why an actor of [Richard] Dreyfuss' stature would find himself in a thin, predictable and wholly contrived indie like Cas & Dylan.
rotten	If there was an original idea in Jesse Gabe's screenplay it died of loneliness long before reaching the screen.
rotten	Leading man Richard Dreyfuss is so irrepressibly charming that he almost saves Jason Priestley's dismal buddy comedy Cas & Dylan from its awkward humor and trite sentimentality.
fresh	Former heart-throb Jason Priestley, making his feature debut as director, keeps the banter ticking along nicely as the bug transports us to a sentimental -- but genuinely touching -- conclusion.
rotten	The film simply mucks up its earnest take on the buddy movie with undercooked characters and on-the-nose writing.
rotten	...an earnest yet underwhelming endeavor that's hardly a cut above most garden-variety made-for-television enterprises...
rotten	Cas & Dylan may have big-name talent for a small Canadian movie but mainly it has tired Hollywood formulas.
fresh	Screenwriter Jessie Gabe has a few surprises up her sleeve, particularly at the end.
fresh	Even if Cas & Dylan isn't as polished as it could be, there are still enough pleasing moments to make this road trip worth the ride.
rotten	Wannabe Christian swashbuckler throws a lot of stuff up on the screen in the hopes that something will stick as exciting and romantic. None of it does.
fresh	The sort of action adventure a Born Again Quentin Tarantino might make.
rotten	It wants to be a faith-based film, a historical drama, and an action/adventure movie at the same time. Those three things are blended together awkwardly, leading to shifts in tone that can be jarring.
rotten	A faith-based swashbuckling Revolutionary War period piece that doesn't have the wit or the budget to quite come off.
fresh	Mankind may be awash in more con men and faith-based swindlers than ever, but precious few are bold enough to step forward into the light of reason, even for a million bucks. Bravo, Mr. Randi.
fresh	"An Honest Liar" is a fitting tribute to a figure whose stamina and wit only appear to be magical.
fresh	A genuinely entertaining feature-length documentary.
fresh	"An Honest Liar" is a fascinating look at what the truth means, and how it means different things to different people. It's also a reminder that no one has a monopoly on it. Not even the Amazing Randi.
fresh	Randi's ability to disclose Popoff's religious perjury will make any skeptic stand and applaud.
fresh	James Randi exposes frauds and charlatans, but is he guilty of deception too?
fresh	Entertaining work, and supplies a welcome introduction to The Amazing Randi.
fresh	Anyone who can challenges faith healers, psychics and mediums who claim a special bond with the dead - and often wins those challenges - deserves a standing ovation.
fresh	It's telling -- even poignant -- that a man supposedly equipped with foolproof "lie-dar" could be duped by the person closest to him.
fresh	Randi's story suggests a modern-day footnote to Herman Melville's novel The Confidence-Man, reflecting the strange interplay between show business, religion, and hucksterism in American life.
fresh	An Honest Liar is an infectiously engaging time capsule that gets a couple of great digs in before that curtain falls.
fresh	A clear-eyed but warm-hearted look at Randi's life and career, one where the subject's deepest secrets are ultimately laid out for all to see.
fresh	[James] Randi has had an amazing life, one that, improbably, gets even more thrilling when he's no longer doing magic
fresh	Randi's a sly charmer, and an engaging guide through the film ...
fresh	After getting to know the TV personality who unmasked psychics as simply magicians themselves, it makes getting to know the man behind the crusade even more powerful.
fresh	Unexpectedly revelatory and deeply moving.
fresh	It would violate a taboo to relate how this movie magic, masterfully orchestrated by Weinstein and Measom, is done. Their film is as smooth as Randi's patter and demonstrates how the documentarian's camera is quicker than the eye.
fresh	In the end, "An Honest Liar" becomes a far more layered tale than it starts out to be.
fresh	A worthwhile portrayal of an intelligent and skilled old-school conjuror who can look the audience in the eye and say, "I'm a deceiver and I'm going to deceive you," and then do just that.
fresh	"An Honest Liar" illustrates a rare phenomenon in documentary: what it means to think, to believe and to challenge what our very own eyes see, and more to the point, do not see.
fresh	This is where An Honest Liar shines: when it lays out how Randi threw wrenches into the careers of several famous frauds.
fresh	"An Honest Liar" isn't simply a career recap or a fond portrait; the movie takes exhilarating turns as directors Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom follow present-day developments in Randi's personal life.
fresh	Documenting a lifetime spent gulling audiences and pursuing con men, the directors Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom have produced a jaunty, jovial portrait with a surprising sting in its tail.
fresh	The film deserves to be seen, and admired, for its own revelations, and for its unlikely, yet deeply affecting, transformation into a story of abiding love that, in its own turn, involves a deception.
rotten	The doc makes a hairpin turn into sentiment, as the realities of immigration law impose themselves on Randi's private relationship with his Venezuelan lover of 25 years.
fresh	a fascinating character: quick-witted, still relatively spry for his age, with an air of mystery, even when he's simply telling the truth.
fresh	Intriguing stuff.
fresh	Plays more like a greatest hits compilation than a biography ...
fresh	A documentary portrait of James Randi that is both entertaining and provocative.
fresh	Bounces along enjoyably on a sea of archival clips from Randi's high-profile career, with latter-day input from numerous celebrity pals (and at least one famous foe).
fresh	Aptly seductive ...
fresh	Deception all around
fresh	Directors Tyler Measom and Justin Weinstein turn a standard bio-doc about an extraordinary man into a rumination on the blurred line between trickery and truth.
fresh	...a profile in heroic rationality.
fresh	Expertly assembled to draw out the suspense of danger lurking around each vacant hill... the movie creates a world of paradoxical sentiments: immediate decision-making pitted against the immovable forces of ideology and moral codes.
fresh	Mortensen's post-Lord of the Rings choices have been an idiosyncratic mix: His my-way-or-the-highway approach doesn't always pay off, but it does here with engrossing results.
fresh	What makes it work is the solemn efficiency of director David Oelhoffen's storytelling and the quiet intensity of the two leads: The rough tenderness of Mortensen's gaze plays off well against Kateb's conflicted demeanor.
rotten	But to expand Camus's slender story to 101 minutes, Oelhoffen decides to say a lot more than the basic dramatic situation necessarily demands.
rotten	Something of a Distinguished Slog.
fresh	Surprisingly affecting.
fresh	Camus sets the movie's initial course, but Mr. Oelhoffen resolutely steers it home with political context, historical hindsight, an unambiguous moral imperative and a pair of well-matched performances; put another way, he makes the story his own.
fresh	It's refreshing to see a sincere paean to nobility, honor, and courage, especially one that periodically elevates the pulse with expertly mounted standoffs.
fresh	This thoughtful, contemplative Western is compelling and well-crafted, even if it's occasionally as slow as a wandering tumbleweed.
rotten	Attempting to expand Camus' rather lean short proves to be a hurdle Oelhoffen can't completely overcome.
fresh	The actual physical locations in Far From Men are stunning, and Oelhoffen smartly emphasizes the emptiness of the desert, which seems to stretch on infinitely behind the characters.
fresh	Despite its episodic structure, Far From Men is a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.
rotten	In all fairness, Albert Camus' short story L'hote (The Guest) may be too spare and lean to fill a full-length feature film. But also in all fairness, it captures its issues in a far more concise and eloquent manner then David Oelhoffen's film.
rotten	The original's existentialist undertow is mostly lost in shallow characterizations and scenes that perfunctorily tip their hat to genre tropes rather than illuminating the characters.
fresh	Writer-director David Oelhoffen's idea of approaching this potent two-hander as an Algeria-set horse opera proves as inspired as it is unexpected.
fresh	Far From Men crafts a haunting atmosphere of alienation for its story of outcasts forging an unlikely bond.
fresh	The film often suggests a less defiant cover of The Defiant Ones, yet it's a must-see for Viggo Mortensen's characteristically wonderful performance.
fresh	A movie based on an Albert Camus story. Now that's existential.
fresh	"Far From Men" never strays far from its western genre roots, except perhaps in its ultimate subtle moral: Nothing, not honor, duty or your personal code, is so important that it trumps the value of your life.
rotten	Appearances are everything in Effie Gray, a film that pushes tasteful restraint to extremes.
fresh	Played with aetherial grace and innate wisdom by Dakota Fanning
rotten	Slow-moving period film makes intriguing tale uninteresting.
rotten	It's deadly dull, clogged with all kinds of string and piano music and sunk by a perplexingly lifeless performance by Dakota Fanning as Gray.
rotten	Fanning's controlled presence is ideal for a tale of Victorian repression. But as the film becomes one of quiet liberation, it needs more than her cool reserve.
rotten	Picturesque scenery, exquisite set/costume designs and solid performances fail to enliven the film which lacks subtlety, often drags and ultimately fails to pack enough of an emotional wallop.
fresh	...attractively shot, appealingly acted, and decorously eye-opening.
fresh	Wise, who is noticeably older than the 29-year-old Ruskin was at the time the events occurred in real life, gives a tense, implacable performance, and Fanning is touching. The movie, however, directed by Richard Laxton, could use a lot more oomph.
fresh	As a female-predicament drama containing art, history, romance and nice scenery, Effie Gray is intelligent, interesting and engrossing.
rotten	A skilled cast fails to lift a morbidly recounted true tale...
rotten	"Downton Abbey" has more action in 10 minutes than "Effie Gray" does in two hours.
rotten	"Effie Gray" runs 108 minutes, yet it feels like it ends right before the real drama is about to begin.
rotten	With a script by Emma Thompson, you might expect Effie Gray to have the same period-piece poignancy as her 1995 take on Sense and Sensibility. No such luck.
rotten	This is an interesting story, but it's treated here in a fashion that's at once timorous and overstated.
fresh	Effie Gray is peculiarly compelling, even if the issue of sexual repression, all the Victorian manners, seem light-years gone and close to unfathomable.
rotten	Fanning feels wafer-thin and out of her element. She's appropriately wan, but as we never know Effie's potential, her loss of identity has minimal punch.
fresh	The best thing about the ultimately involving way this romantic drama ends up on screen is that it's sure to arouse enough interest to make those who don't already know the outcome more than eager to look it up.
rotten	While it has some lovely moments, "Effie Gray" is a bit underwhelming; it's odd that an artist so acclaimed for her wit would produce a script so chilly, so dour.
fresh	Thompson herself plays a sort of proto-feminist advisor, but the enemy here isn't misogyny so much as it is gynophobia.
fresh	Visually voluptuous, though the pacing occasionally suggests watching a Pre-Raphaelite dry.
rotten	It's a lamentable if not especially engrossing story, part wronged-woman narrative, part marital horror movie.
fresh	Thompson largely succeeds at giving Effie a voice, much as Fanning succeeds at beautifully bringing it to life. But the world around Effie remains crudely drawn, and in that respect the film can only do so much justice to her story.
rotten	Insomniacs should seek out Effie Gray if only for the sound night's sleep they will get after experiencing this inert snooze-fest.
fresh	The counterpoint of styles comments on Ruskin with irony and subtlety; as such it succeeds as criticism - and as art.
rotten	What at least could have been a satisfyingly Gothic true-life version of 'Jane Eyre' is merely one huge bore.
rotten	Listless and airless, and we yearn for Effie's emancipation largely so we can escape ourselves.
fresh	"Effie Gray" is a powerful look at early feminism. Instead of accepting her fate in a bad marriage like many Victorian women advised her to do, Effie fights her way out of it - scandal be damned.
rotten	This period piece, directed by Richard Laxton, is shot in such a grim and grainy fashion you long to turn on the lights - which is fitting, because you also wish the filmmakers had illuminated the characters a bit more clearly.
fresh	It's a sumptuously elegant picture, but a disappointingly timid and decorous work that takes more care in outlining oppression than in creating a compelling protagonist. Her suffering is interesting, but she is not.
rotten	Thompson makes Ruskin such a cardboard villain, playing on stereotypes of the cold, stuffy intellectual, that she turns Gray's story into a tastefully dreary domestic-prison saga.
rotten	The movie has a very methodical pace, which sometimes verges on sluggish. And the soft focus of certain light-filled scenes doesn't make Effie look angelic so much as it makes the director appear amateurish.
rotten	On a purely technical level, Effie Gray is fine, if uninspired, with its washed-out color, attention to detail, and lack of heavy-handed moralizing. As an experience, though, it's a drag without much reward.
rotten	The film itself begins to feel like Gray, a pretty bird in a gilded cage with nowhere to fly.
rotten	I'm willing to embrace boring British period pieces as much as the next critic. But there are limits.
fresh	Fanning is a worthy muse for Thompson. She has developed into an actress who can convey considerable depth and feeling behind those haunting pale blue eyes.
rotten	Like watching paint dry on an exquisite masterpiece.
rotten	Fanning is miscast, offering a flat performance that finds Effie searching the world with dead eyes.
rotten	We'll never know how mismatched Ruskin and Effie were in real life, but in Ms. Thompson's tactful but muted version of the truth, they seem to be in a stupor.
fresh	The Victorian melodrama in "Effie Gray'' works better than the Victorian suffering.
rotten	A painfully obvious attack on the past and its regressive mores that does little but reward viewers for (hopefully) not being sexist pigs.
rotten	You can feel the good intentions vibrating off the screen, but it's still a listless affair, one that takes forever to go almost nowhere.
rotten	The rare period piece that resists a helpful infusion of modern-day freshness, Effie Gray is entombed by the same emotional repressiveness that frustrated its namesake.
rotten	When it comes to casting Fannings, if you can't get Elle, no Fanning is better than any Fanning available.
rotten	Effie Gray is an exquisitely dreary slice of middlebrow armchair theater which adds little new to a much-filmed story.
rotten	A peculiar slice of 19th-century cultural life is mined to minimal effect in Effie Gray, a stillborn labour of love that doesn't justify the long slog from screenwriter and supporting player Emma Thompson required to bring this tale to the screen.
rotten	Not even Emma Thompson can breathe life into this middlebrow look at Victorian rigidities.
fresh	It spins the narrative of one of the Victorian art world's most mysterious marriages into a study of life lived and life merely examined, a fecund fairy tale in reverse.
rotten	The tragic sadness of a Victorian wife and the unraveling of her marriage might be a worthy subject but, as brought to the screen by so reverently and bloodlessly, Effie Gray is a bit of a drag.
rotten	A stultifyingly dreary costume drama that's far too timid and tasteful for its own good.
rotten	The film needed further salvation. Fanning excels as a sleeping beauty slowly awakening, but Thompson and Wise are both miscast.
rotten	Compared with the daring vision of Mike Leigh's Mr Turner, Effie Gray is a disappointingly safe and dull affair.
fresh	Fifty Shades Of 'Gray'? A different Dakota's deranged deconstruction on screen, though conversely as a sexless slave in matrimonial bondage. While touching on class/gender solidarity with the butler, and possibly pedophilia. Emma Thompson, you rock.
rotten	In the title role, Dakota Fanning has a certain haunted grace. But in cinematic terms Effie Gray is painting by numbers.
rotten	This admirable, watercolor-delicate tale of individual feminist emancipation never quite blooms into living color, hampered by spotty casting and Richard Laxton's overly deliberate direction.
fresh	It may be billed as a "love triangle", but there's precious little love on display, even in our heroine's growing affection for pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais.
fresh	Set in London, Venice and the wilds of Scotland, Effie Gray is a very beautiful, elegant period drama.
fresh	A fascinating, albeit strangely downbeat, costume drama.
rotten	If ever a story cried out for the richly saturated, passionate tones of melodrama, it's Effie Gray.
fresh	Based on a notorious true story, this film takes a muted approach that matches the Victorian period and attitudes, which somewhat undermines the vivid emotions of the characters.
fresh	The film generates potent, often claustrophobic drama while never losing our sympathy for the fragile, resilient Effie.
fresh	A marriage cut down by Victorian prejudice is at the centre of this intriguing, Emma Thompson-penned historical drama.
fresh	Well scripted, efficiently directed, handsomely dressed and furnished, and vigorously acted.
fresh	An unexpectedly entertaining movie about this marital disaster and Gray's subsequent romance with the painter John Everett Millais.
rotten	The trouble is, the film is as stifled and repressed as the emotions it is attempting to describe, and cannot make a go of the romantic element, which simply refuses to fly.
rotten	Handsome, well-mounted but dull, dull, dull.
fresh	There's little humour and - despite the best efforts of the cast - it's all a little stiff and one-dimensional.
fresh	There are clever and sensitive touches right through, and a moving ending. But Fanning seems wholly uncomfortable, and not always intentionally.
rotten	Dakota Fanning's almost hypnotically-blank performance eventually becomes a dulling drag on Effie Gray ...
fresh	Ultimately, this is an enjoyable, if slightly sluggish biopic that overcomes its flaws thanks to Thompson's way with dialogue, although it doesn't tug on the heartstrings as surely as you might hope.
fresh	While admiring director Richard Laxton for this brooding, somewhat elusive piece, the audience are left to crave a defining, dramatic moment, or an impactful crescendo to illuminate this narrative.
fresh	A thoughtful, well-acted and perceptive drama - but for a film about a love triangle, the sparks don't exactly fly.
fresh	The result is dark and offbeat, but as a murky anti-romance, Gray is undeniably effective.
rotten	This kind of formalism needs to do more than walk through classical wonders. It should want to create cinema that can stand near or beside them. This movie defensively consecrates what's already there. You don't need a film to do that.
fresh	An exquisite rumination on life, love and art that tickles the heart and mind in equal measure.
fresh	Green's richly textured, painterly images fuse with the story to evoke the essence of humane urbanity and the relationships that it fosters, whether educational, familial, or erotic.
fresh	Green doesn't so much use his characters as mouthpieces as emotionally invest them in art, turning opinions into feelings.
fresh	"La Sapienza" strikes this reviewer as easily the most astonishing and important movie to emerge from France in quite some time.
fresh	The movie is an unapologetically rarefied undertaking and at the same time a gracious and inviting film.
rotten	Pretentious, stuffy and slow. There's some beautiful scenery here but oh, what you must put up with to earn it!
fresh	While La Sapienza is unsatisfying as drama, it's frequently beautiful just as a tour through architecturally significant Italian buildings.
fresh	La Sapienza  alternately feels like a self-reflexive love story or a haunted history lesson -- its best scenes play like both.
fresh	A picture that balances heart and mind with nuance.
fresh	As in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," both the younger couple and their older mentors are changed from a relationship.
fresh	This recalls Manoel de Oliveira and Eric Rohmer in its poker-faced style, deliberately archaic storytelling, and magisterial epiphanies.
fresh	Although a love-fiction crossed with documentary lecture and superb Raphael O'Byrne cinematography, 'La Sapienza' is as close as celluloid can approach to architecture.
fresh	Eugene Green's mannered direction doesn't work for every situation it's homogenously applied to, but at its most effective it inspires an enhanced sensitivity to the import of every gesture, visual or verbal.
rotten	There might be an engaging film buried beneath the severe dialogue, portentous music and ominous shadows of "1915." But a relentless and heavy-handed script makes the effort to find it seem futile.
fresh	I want to know more about the history of the Armenian Massacre but found myself being told of the problems producing a play in current-day Los Angeles.
fresh	The film plays out like a pensive, high-minded version of "Birdman or (the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)."
fresh	Thankfully, after this rocky start, the filmmakers largely find their footing to deliver riveting storylines that provide important history lessons along the way.
rotten	1915 is sadly dull and didactic, even within the parameters of a film whose primary purpose is to educate rather than entertain.
rotten	This sweet, play-it-safe adaptation of TV's honeybee heroine is as innocuous and uninspired as preschool animation gets.
rotten	"Maya the Bee" embodies the kind of self-consciously uplifting treacle some adults insist kids want. They package "Maya" like honey, but it tastes like medicine.
fresh	The film's messages about friendship, acceptance and being yourself are clear enough for the young, and grown-ups can read the story as a warning about conformity and about going to war on false pretenses.
rotten	The film achieves a level of proficient mediocrity early on and hovers there for the rest of its slender running time.
rotten	More harmless than entertaining.
fresh	I really loved it. I loved Maya.
fresh	It's a nice film but... nice.
fresh	Maya herself is voiced by nine-year-old Gillies who does a jolly, infectious job as an innocent heroine.
fresh	Cute bee adventure teaches about inclusion and cooperation.
rotten	While parents may struggle with the relentless perkiness of the ever giggling baby bee, little ones may get lost in an overly complex story that would have benefited from judicious pruning.
fresh	Altogether the best exploration of Australian class conflicts through the medium of animated insects that you're likely to see this year.
rotten	It's a wearyingly familiar story -- and even the jokes, mostly insect puns, aren't the kind that adults are likely to enjoy.
fresh	"1971" is an appropriately matter-of-fact title for a decidedly low-key documentary. But don't mistake a lack of flash for an absence of substance.
fresh	Hamilton nevertheless skilfully evokes the era's turbulent political and social climate, with genuine suspense generated during the heist matched by unexpected humour.
fresh	Minor quibbles aside, it's an important documentary.
fresh	[A] riveting, revelatory documentary.
fresh	Johanna Hamilton's 1971 may not be as dynamic or immediate a documentary as executive producer Laura Poitras's Citizenfour, but as a look at the earliest iteration of America as a security state, it's essential.
fresh	For those who care about personal freedoms, this well-crafted and illuminating film is required viewing.
fresh	A belated tribute to some fearless patriots with the gumption to expose the FBI's lawless ways and the wherewithal to evade apprehension by the Bureau to boot!
fresh	It might seem like a history lesson, but this compelling documentary has plenty of contemporary relevance.
fresh	Johanna Hamilton's 1971 represents a mind-blowing scoop disguised as a fairly garden-variety issue doc.
fresh	[1971] benefits mightily from superb re-enactments, the palpable integrity of its activist band of break-in artists, and some Rififi-like suspenseful moments.
fresh	Ms. Hamilton's straightforward documentary skillfully interweaves reminiscences by members of the group with re-enactments of the burglary.
fresh	Their message-namely, Who will watch the watchmen?-remains as important today as it was 44 years ago.
fresh	This is a terrific time capsule with a resonant message.
rotten	Mostly, the film is much ado about nothing (though the break-in led eventually to a Freedom of Information Act document dump that revealed details about the FBI spying on Martin Luther King Jr.).
fresh	Even if it doesn't quite qualify as breaking news, 1971 certainly has the urgency of the past speaking to the present.
fresh	Timely! As riveting and illuminating as The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers.
fresh	The story, including its cat-and-mouse aftermath, adds the intricate excitement of a thriller to righteous historical outrage.
fresh	An important addition to the filmography of dissent-oriented political docs.
fresh	The film offers surprisingly cogent, lived-in evocations of a period too often glossed over in impersonal, by-the-book montages.
fresh	Real-life Oceans 11 plays out as political thriller with eerie timeliness in exposure of a 40-year-old mystery. Shadowy reenactments are suspensefully credible and effective.
fresh	A riveting history lesson, aided by the real burglars coming out publicly for the very first time.
fresh	A salute to civil disobedience, told in the voices of ordinary people who broke the law on ethical grounds.
fresh	...a thrilling lesson about how authoritarianism can be curbed, sometimes, by one simple and well-targeted blow.
rotten	Ryan Gosling's stylish and evocative directorial debut shows some potential even if his script is a muddled and incoherent mess.
rotten	Ryan Gosling has taken many great visual skills from his time with director Nicholas Winding Refn, but unfortunately his writing still has a long way to go, turning Lost River into an aimless and bland experience to rival Refn's own Only God Forgives.
rotten	Indulgent and movie-like, Lost River is Gosling's weird, let's-do-this-thing folly. If it is a statement, it is one made by borrowing the vivid styles of the actual filmmakers he seems to admire ...
fresh	Designed to daze and confuse, and succeeding, Ryan Gosling's directorial debut is a stunner in visual terms alone.
rotten	Nothing wrong with a bit of hero-worship/homage, but Ryan Gosling's writing/directing debut is a little too self-Refn-rential for its own good.
rotten	Stylized drama about poverty has some disturbing violence.
rotten	...what might happen if David Lynch were ever to shoot a nature documentary.
rotten	While Lost River isn't some misunderstood masterpiece, neither is it as awful as advertised.
fresh	Ryan Gosling's directorial debut is avowedly arty and rich to the point of bursting its seams.
rotten	Ryan Gosling is a tremendously talented actor, but he should really leave the storytelling to someone else.
fresh	Worth a gamble. Hell, you might love it.
rotten	Gosling may craft the occasional moment of strange, demented beauty, but his reliance on dream logic and over-use of the sub-Terrence Malick-style imagery that has pervaded American indie cinema in recent years doesn't convince.
rotten	It's presumably a labour of love, yet it doesn't give you any sense of a personality or imagination behind the camera.
fresh	When it premiered at Cannes last year, Gosling's urban fairytale was greeted with jeers. It should have been met with cheers.
rotten	Lost River is a bit of a mess, yes, but it should not be dismissed outright. There are some interesting ideas here, and although it is never pleasant or easy to watch, Lost River isn't a lost cause-it's just uneven.
fresh	De Caestecker is the real star of this show, with an effortless performance full of heart.
rotten	"Lost River" is one of those weird films that I think some people will absolutely adore, grabbing on to its performances, imagery, and ideas, without really caring that they haven't been stitched together in an interesting enough way.
fresh	Gosling isn't making "Lost River" to be loved. He's purging demons here, scratching film appreciation itches, demanding a type of adventurous moviegoer who can digest the random and celebrate the insane.
rotten	A pretentious burlesque of a film in which you are never entirely sure what Gosling is trying to say.
fresh	An often dazzling and always thought-provoking modern fairy tale that's never less than beautiful to look at.
fresh	"Lost River" is indeed a mess, but it's the best mess possible, an evocative grab-bag of images and moods with a heartfelt sincerity and conflicting impulses of romantic melancholy and hardscrabble hopefulness.
rotten	Ryan Gosling's directorial debut is a misfiring, wildly self-indulgent affair, but with flickerings of brilliance along the way. Individual sequences play like short films in their own right.
rotten	[Gosling] seems to have dug up some lurid offcuts from a Nicolas Winding Refn movie, and mashed then up with David Lynch and Edward Hopper.
fresh	Gosling is clearly angling for a parable on American consumerism, but he's more concerned with arresting fantasy-noir visuals, surreal dreamscapes and weird atmospheres than a coherent story.
fresh	At heart, "Lost River" is a midnight movie for those ready to find it and go with the flow.
fresh	The movie owes a sizable debt to David Lynch and to Nicolas Winding Refn, who directed Mr. Gosling in "Drive" and "Only God Forgives," but it reveals Mr. Gosling as a filmmaker with a poetic sensibility of his own.
fresh	If you're willing to go with it, it'll sweep you away.
rotten	Mediocrity, in this instance at least, denotes complacency, and Lost River exhibits on every level a "will-this-do?" quality.
rotten	Lost River is a film whose reputation precedes it. Viewers have decried it as a mess or lauded it as an artistic achievement ever since it premiered at Cannes 11 months ago. Ultimately, the film is really neither.
fresh	Plays more like a curious, sincere experiment of a promising new storyteller rather than the egotistical self-indulgence of an A-List actor.
rotten	Where Gosling goes wrong is in the priggish bombast. Instead of Refn and Lynch's self-contained worlds, he attempts Serious Commentary about the American Dream. But the actor shows no understanding of how poverty works.
rotten	With his writing-directing debut, Ryan Gosling shows audacious skill as a visual artist but never quite manages to recount a story that grabs hold of the audience...
rotten	Everything in it passes before the eyes before seeping out of the memory, which, given how ugly some of it is, is just as well.
rotten	The film proves that Gosling has refined taste in movies, and that he's a quick study, but not that he has much to say as an artist. Not yet, anyway.
rotten	Lost River comes across as the work of a poseur, but it's not that far away from being the striking, left-field cult vision Gosling clearly hoped it would be.
rotten	Gosling gets points for style but Lost River proves he's not quite ready for prime time as a filmmaker.
rotten	It comes across like the college coursework of a film student trying to convince the girl of his dreams that he is 'deep' and that he 'gets stuff'.
rotten	The story, more a tangle of violent, symbolic gestures, regards economic exploitation with fetishistic, impossibly overdetermined abandon.
rotten	"Lost River" is no misunderstood masterpiece, but at its best it makes you hope Gosling takes what works here and develops it into something stronger next time.
rotten	For half an hour, you have no clue what you're watching. Is it Malickian myth-making, a Lynchian bad trip, or Refn-style violent revenge? Then you realise Gosling has no idea either ...
rotten	An often risibly pretentious film that seems relentlessly drawn to the incomprehensible.
rotten	Lost River is a daring film that wears its influences with pride, but there's something missing as Gosling leads us into a dark abyss of Gothic clubs, dancing Aussies, and underwater mysteries.
fresh	At its worst, Lost River is a film to be looked at, not experienced, but at least it always looks intriguing.
rotten	After a strong, visually striking, resonant start, Lost River quickly descends into a fugue of memorable imagery signifying little and regularly abandons its established motifs for others.
rotten	It's fitting that in the credits [Gosling] thanks Guillermo del Toro, though perhaps he really should thank David Lynch.
rotten	A gruesome fairy tale of evil banks and sunken dreams, Lost River is a fantastically awful misfire from actor turned writer/director Ryan Gosling.
fresh	Any five minutes of the film would be well-suited to a cool music video, with only the last fifteen minutes or so threatening to become genuinely, giddily unhinged.
rotten	These days models turn designer, footballers become managers - and actors direct. Why not? Lost River, Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, is why not.
rotten	The film is ultimately kind of juvenile and dumb, and there are more moments where you'll roll your eyes rather than inwardly applauding.
rotten	It's an oneiric hymn to destruction, an Armageddon anthem - a movie to see, if at all, under the influence.
fresh	To say that Ryan Gosling's directorial debut feels more like a practice run than a true first feature sounds like condemnation, but the result of his experimentation is a striking and often mesmerising muddle.
rotten	For Gosling, Lost River has treacherous waters indeed.
fresh	Ryan Gosling wanted to make an art film and, despite some dull patches, pretty much succeeded.
rotten	A chimeric stroke job that leaves you utterly unfulfilled.
fresh	It's the work of a surprisingly confident and experimental young filmmaker, even if he's not yet confident enough to move beyond his influences.
rotten	An over-cooked affair that lacks much needed wit and humour to go alongside its self-aware art intentions.
rotten	For "River" read "Opportunity" or "Any Sense Of Proportion Or Humility" or maybe just "Mind".
rotten	A film so mind-bogglingly pleased with itself that the words "five stars - a masterpiece - Ryan Gosling" might as well appear on the poster.
rotten	A visual and aural sensory bath that shows some real flair but feels madly derivative at every moment.
rotten	Ryan Gosling makes an altogether inauspicious debut with this risible slab of Detroit gothic.
fresh	In the life force and in death, the two species coexist, complement and mirror one another.
fresh	Erlingsson makes wonderful use of the striking landscape as he weaves together a series of interlinking stories which veers from darkly amusing tales of death and sex through to more disturbing fare.
fresh	Strikingly good-looking if somewhat narratively uneven.
fresh	Flabbergasting images and a delightfully dry sense of humor make Of Horses and Men a debut worthy of celebration.
fresh	[Erlingsson] pushes ahead with efficient visuals, snappy transitions and a driving score split between cantering rhythms and choral hymns.
fresh	Of Horses and Men is the rare honest film about horses, one as frank about their tubelike erections as it is caught up in the beauty of gaits and forelocks and that profusion of lashes over those moistly delicate eyes.
fresh	Think of this as a western of the far north - one with no bad guys, a few stunts and showdowns, and horses who share top billing with their riders.
fresh	If you want to see the year's most original, comedic and shocking film all rolled into one, look no further than this feature from Iceland.
fresh	Of Horses and Men is the best Icelandic noir equine comedy I have ever seen. OK, it's also the only one, but I urge you to seek out this unexpected movie.
fresh	One of the pleasures of this film is the extent to which the horses really do feel like part of the narrative.
fresh	The tone veers from quirky observation to bleak contemplation, with a streak of dry cruelty - particularly when viewed through the reflective eyes of the horses upon which Erlingsson repeatedly focuses.
fresh	The Icelandic director Benedikt Erlingsson's debut feature is a wondrously strange affair, full of beautiful imagery of Icelandic horses set against rugged, frozen backdrops.
fresh	Erlingsson makes striking use of Iceland's volcanic landscapes as he links a collection of stories on love, death, loyalty, suffering and sacrifice in which magnificent horses play a central role.
fresh	Equine capers abound in Benedikt Erlingsson's surprising and charming debut.
fresh	[A] bizarre, offbeat Icelandic gem.
fresh	A rather bracing film in which the insides of humans interact with the outsides of horses. Humans' outsides feel the benefit of horses' insides, too.
fresh	Think of Arthur Miller/John Huston's The Misfits. Add volcanic scenery and bleak comedy.
fresh	The viewpoint may be unfamiliar, but the sights are unforgettable.
fresh	Benedikt Erlingsson's magnificently rugged-looking film offers darkly comic mishaps that play out over a series of sly vignettes.
fresh	Wonderful.
fresh	Vividly shot, this is a strange and seductive portmanteau of Icelandic tales.
fresh	Affectionate, but scenes of death and horse love may not be for the squeamish.
fresh	On one hand, the film is surely a celebration of a land's distinct creatures and the people who live among them, but on the other, it's a culture's biting auto-critique.
fresh	Erlingsson has delivered an attractive slice of Icelandic oddness that confirms many of the cliches about that country's offbeat outlook, but in a good way.
rotten	The bickering quickly grows tiresome and cancels any emotional investment.
fresh	This is an unusual movie, especially when you look back and realize how usual it seemed going in.
rotten	Helen Hunt tries to soften her image with this vanity project, but the whole affair is a little too on-the-nose to offer big laughs or surprises
fresh	Mom gets her groove back in charming, not-too-edgy drama.
rotten	Helen Hunt goes auteur again in a supposedly hard-hitting character study that ultimately feels more like a shallow vanity project.
fresh	While the subject matter in Ride is a bit rote, the performances and zing-a-minute dialogue keep this low budget picture above water.
rotten	Hunt is past the breakers and alone on her own wave; as a filmmaker, she's lost sight of the shore.
rotten	This is suitably engaging coming-of-middle-age material, but at nearly every turn, Hunt shines in one discipline while leaving much to be desired in another.
rotten	As an instructional movie on the sport, "Ride" offers some useful tips, but beyond that, it feels like a slightly bizarre vanity project.
fresh	Hunt has a long history in comedy, but Ride reveals that she can direct it as well as perform it.
rotten	Occasionally engaging, Ride suffers from being desperate to please, overwrought and overwritten with sitcom-style shenanigans backed up by a goofily chirpy score.
rotten	Here's the thing about playing someone who's tiresome and unpleasant: You run the risk of creating a movie that's tiresome and unpleasant.
rotten	There are good things in it, but Ms. Hunt is smart, observant and bright enough to make films that resonate with more freshness than this. Maybe next time.
rotten	It's hard to miss the irony of Jackie counseling her son over how story endings should feel "surprising but inevitable" in a movie that's all inevitability and no surprise.
rotten	Hunt seems to confuse fast-talking with crackling banter, and the mother-son bond is way ickier than it is cute.
rotten	Technically, most of this proceeds smoothly; on a writing level, it's something of a mess.
fresh	"Ride'' sounds a bit like a Lifetime movie, but in Hunt's capable hands it's a brisk, funny and touching comedy for boomers.
fresh	Sitcom touches to make the movie malleable are unwelcome, but when Hunt works up the courage to avoid the obvious, she delivers welcome pathos.
fresh	There's a wry sweetness to this picture ...
fresh	Anyone sniffing that "Ride" looks like wish fulfillment for women of a certain age would do well to consider how many wretched films we sit through in the name of wish fulfillment for young men; a little equality in entertainment goes a long way.
fresh	If the film wins you over, it's in large part thanks to Hunt, a force to be reckoned with in front of the camera, if less so behind it.
fresh	Ride is at its best and most authentic in its final chapter and an inconclusive resolution, but not so sure-footed in how it gets there.
fresh	Hunt hurls herself headlong into the role of this stubborn, controlling, self-satisfied, intensely judgmental woman, making it all the more gratifying when her veneer of self-possession begins to crack and we begin to warm to her in spite of ourselves.
rotten	Throughout, Helen Hunt obsequiously tends to her character's evolution as a parent through a flagrant indulgence of sitcom-ish scenarios.
fresh	Alternately vulnerable and bizarre, but always endearing, the Saturday Night Live alum enjoys her best outing since Bridesmaids, here, as an anguished soul allowed, against her better judgment, to purchase a terribly-embarrassing, 15 minutes of fame.
rotten	Kristen Wiig dazzles in what may be her best performance to date - and what is certainly her trickiest - but the actress is diminished by how unexpectedly rudderless the film feels.
fresh	...hilariously wacky and touching Welcome to Me, a showcase for what Wiig can do when put front and center.
fresh	It's here that Wiig's wallflower wit finally dovetails with a lead role that has the depth to support it, as the film evolves into an exuberant cross between Synecdoche, New York and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!
fresh	Moviegoers might be too busy enjoying themselves to realize that by the time it's over, they don't know much more about Alice's condition than they did beforehand.
rotten	It's the equivalent of tripping someone on crutches and then inviting her over for tea.
fresh	Malicious, hilarious and heartbreaking ... one of the biggest movie surprises of 2015 so far.
rotten	I'm not even sure it can be called a movie; it feels like a setup and a character in search of a story.
fresh	Irreverent but somewhat disturbing look at mental illness.
fresh	"Welcome to Me" basically lives and dies by [Wiig's] performance, and, luckily, her Alice Klieg is a carefully and cunningly crafted creation, which exposes an undercurrent of pain and sorrow beneath her often placid, pixilated state.
rotten	The most recent in a series of Wiig's depressed/repressed roles. No one's asking for a perky rom-com, but please, something different.
fresh	Though some of the jabs "Me" takes at reality TV are clever, the film, like Alice, tends to fracture at key moments. What makes it worth watching is Wiig.
fresh	By turns touching, amusing and genuinely disturbing, it defies expectations and easy categorization, forgoing obvious laughs and cheap emotional payoffs in favor of something much odder and more interesting.
rotten	Has a few funny moments, but much of this dryly squirmy humor is laced with a pall of deep sadness and concern for a protagonist who is clearly psychologically unstable.
fresh	A frolicsome comedy that gives Kristen Wiig a chance to strut her stuff.
rotten	The movie is nothing more than a labored series of skits that play like ideas from rejected TV pilots.
fresh	There are a number of obvious directions Welcome To Me could take this material, and part of what makes it so refreshing, and insightful, is that it takes none of them.
fresh	Diverting but slightly queasy fun.
fresh	There's a super-insane film inside "Welcome to Me," one that, as it happens, takes up about 80 percent of the picture. What's another 20 percent?
rotten	Welcome To Me can't quite figure out what to do with this ludicrous premise.
fresh	"Welcome to Me" is not just a character study, but a satire on how the self-centered emptiness of TV is a kind of epidemic.
rotten	It all plays more like a long, dark TV comedy sketch than an actual movie.
fresh	The movie's messy. But it's funny, pungent, and sometimes affecting.
rotten	Maddeningly indulgent, an "SNL" sketch that goes on and on...
fresh	Funny, dark, and riding a very fine line in its depiction of mental illness, it may be the best thing we could hope would emerge from the side of Wiig that gave us Gilly.
fresh	In the burnt-toast black Sundance comedy, Kristen Wiig goes dark and bipolar without losing her shield of likeability. It's a superpower to be marveled at, like the ability to carry on a long conversation without looking at one's mobile device.
fresh	The film rejects a fawning (or even particularly detailed) account of mental illness in favor of a plunge into the deep end of a bottomless ego.
fresh	The movie's idiosyncratic delights pack a wild metaphorical punch.
fresh	Kristen Wiig may well be the top communicator of dry humor in the movies today.
rotten	"Welcome to Me" plays like an elaborate origin story for one of Wiig's "Saturday Night Live" characters. It's a boldly odd movie, but odd is all it is.
fresh	...it's hard to deny that the actress sporadically delivers a far more raw and naked performance than one has come to expect.
fresh	[Wiig] has one of the balliest acting careers out there.
fresh	Kristen Wiig plays a woman with borderline personality disorder in this startlingly inspired comedy from Shira Piven.
fresh	In "Welcome to Me" we are spoiled by the comedic capabilities of Kristen Wiig, an expert doing what she does best. We wouldn't really want it any other way.
rotten	I would have thrown something at Goliath myself if I thought it would move the story along.
fresh	Horror film succeeds through skill and not surprise
fresh	Successfully scratches that primal itch, with some genuinely tense results. Uncomplicated isn't always a bad thing.
fresh	Is that a black bear outside our tent, or just some creepy dude?
rotten	Backcountry may zig instead of zag from its facile setup, but even the payoff doesn't stand out.
fresh	These types of creature-feature horror movies are a dime a dozen, but writer-director Adam MacDonald proves there's life left in the genre with his tense and terrifying thriller.
rotten	Monotonous and foreseeable with spastic choreography, Backcountry is horrific for all of the wrong reasons.
fresh	"Backcountry" inevitably brings on the bloody, but it finds atmospheric ways to depict how the bucolic hush of a nature getaway can morph into a survival nightmare for the unprepared.
fresh	Exceptionally put together and sharply paced, acquiring a unique level of efficiency for the genre, while reviving man vs. nature formula with a stimulating rush of human vulnerability.
fresh	...an effective horror thriller with fine performances from its little known cast.
fresh	A couple of weekend backpackers face off against man and beast in director Adam MacDonald's accomplished, blunt-force wilderness adventure.
fresh	The alone-in-the-wilderness survival number gets a serious kick in the hindquarters ... MacDonald harvests gooseflesh the old-fashioned way, by suggesting much, showing little.
fresh	It's beautifully tense and well-acted - the kind of modest genre picture we don't see enough of these days.
fresh	Apparently inspired by a true story that the movie made me very much not want to look up, which I suppose may be taken by some to be a token of its effectiveness.
fresh	Just when you thought it was safe to stand up to a bear in the woods, this jarring indie horror drama will make you scurry back indoors.
fresh	This isn't about the bear. [It's] about two people who get in way over their heads in thinking they know nature and each other...
fresh	For most of its 91 tense, uneven minutes, "Backcountry" plays on your nerves like a kid flicking you with a rubber band.
fresh	Backcountry is potent in its moments of sheer animal panic, reminding the viewer that humans, for all our advanced technology and intellectual vanity, are powerless against the faceless cruelty of nature.
fresh	Knowing that the situations depicted in actor and filmmaker Adam MacDonald's Backcountry are based on "true events" only makes them more harrowing to watch unfold onscreen.
fresh	On one hand, this kind of narrative serves to remind us that we haven't totally vanquished the natural world and it retains some of its ancient dangers. But on a deeper level, something more complicated and sinister is going on.
fresh	Concocted with ace precision, worthy of a spectacle of well-earned winces and gasps.
fresh	MacDonald elevates Backcountry by couching what turns out to be a keenly observed relationship drama inside a horror flick.
fresh	Almost traumatically intense. The film continually cranks up the danger, creating a scenario that becomes more and more harrowing with every passing minute. A superb chiller.
fresh	A survivalist drama made all the more scary since it is based on a true story and since the bears are real, not animatronic.
rotten	Backcountry is simply another paranoid cinematic reminder that exiting the beaten path is a course best avoided - or, at least, one that also requires taking some basic, common-sense precautions beforehand.
rotten	After a surprising development, the film grows slack and sentimental, reverting to the survival-movie platitude about hardship making you a better human.
fresh	The vicarious thrills of getting lost in the cinematic wilderness have apparently yet to be exhausted.
fresh	As in Open Water and Black Water, nature is a hulking, roaring reality rather than a CGI imitation, brought into alarming contact with the two human characters via skilled wrangling and clever compositing.
fresh	Backcountry is a blood-soaked campfire treat that confidently hits on nature's unpredictable fury and features a brilliant turn by Missy Peregrym as a bruised, battered and beaten survivalist.
fresh	The story is stuffed with exaggeration, elongation, elaboration, but it's all in the service of making a commonplace circumstance - love - look like it feels when it happens to you, i.e. the very opposite of commonplace.
fresh	Plympton will be cheated if "Cheatin'" doesn't at least get nominated for a best animated feature Oscar.
fresh	The whole range of human emotion - love, lust, anger, jealousy, despair, grief - is felt through Plympton's animation. It's just a shame that his boundless creativity doesn't extend to the narrative.
fresh	By far the best of the four or five of the seven Plympton features that I've seen. What he used to do with faces, he now does with figures, abstracting them to Plastic Man arms and s-curves.
fresh	Perhaps [Plympton's] most ambitious and visually impressive work yet.
fresh	The film is extremely rich in visual inventiveness and depth of feeling -- with numerous sequences that could almost pass muster as individual shorts.
fresh	The visuals are consistently brilliant, Plympton's delving into human nature is unparalleled in recent animation, and the imaginative conceits that spit forth without respite are very near mind-blowing. He's a Rube Goldberg of the psyche.
fresh	Bill Plympton's latest feature-length animation, about a loving couple riven by infidelity, contains some of his loveliest fantasy sequences, though the gap between his visual and storytelling skills persists.
rotten	At times it comes to life, but for the most part it's a bit one-note and repetitive.
fresh	...Cheatin' at least proves that though hand-drawn animation may be one of the oldest forms of the medium, it's plenty lively and colorful when its practitioners care.
fresh	In an earnest bid to balance noir and nutty, neither benefits, in this otherwise anti-Disney fantasy freakout counting super-macho misery and objectified devious damsels in undress popping up. Perhaps revealing more about the filmmaker than anything else.
fresh	"Cheatin'" is a highlight of Plympton's robust body of work because motion-not the journey, or the destination-is always its creator's priority.
fresh	Even at 76 minutes it feels stretched, but Plympton's vivid hand-drawn visuals-one sequence hurls a man through a boxcar, into the sky, underwater, and off a cliff-never lose their electric charge.
fresh	Like every other great animator, from Chuck Jones to Hayao Miyazaki, Mr. Plympton rewrites the laws of physics at will, but within a rigorous and coherent logic. He conjures a world of absolute improbability that, somehow, makes perfect sense.
rotten	Like trying to drink a gallon of chocolate syrup without a milk chaser.
rotten	Cheatin' offers little narrative or emotional advantage over watching a series of the director's more concise works. At 76 minutes, it should play like a short feature. Instead, it's more like an extra-long short.
fresh	Plympton manages to keep it lively with one stunningly kinetic setpiece after another, many of which could easily be airlifted out of the picture to function as stand-alone shorts.
fresh	It's hard to imagine any American studio movie this year that possesses the same liberating creativity found here.
fresh	Brimming with extraordinary heart and imagination.
fresh	If you were a Bill Plympton character, your skull would be riven open by the experience of watching Cheatin', the animator's first feature since '08.
fresh	The plot is pure pulp, inspired in equal parts by the tropes and imagery of film noir, grand opera, and silent melodrama.
fresh	At a time when so many computer-generated features have an increasingly homogenized look, Plympton is a welcome reminder that the art of animation is too protean to be limited to a single visual style, medium or point of view.
rotten	... felt like I was watching a string of loosely connected episodes rather than a feature film.
fresh	Feels fresh and alive, perhaps even more so in an era dominated by smooth, computer-generated cartoons.
fresh	Strife and sexual humor reign in this energetic romp, one of Bill Plympton's best longform animated works.
rotten	The sub-Apocalypse Now existential/colonial angst lacks any form of grounding, despite committed performances from the core cast who engage in much tooth-baring, breast-beating, and shouty soul-searching.
rotten	A glum, ear-splitting rehash of familiar elements from The Hurt Locker and Saving Private Ryan with the slippery aliens as a side dish rather than a great threat.
rotten	There are some inventive moments along the way, but these are interspersed with lots of posturing, yelling and brawling.
fresh	It all makes for a powerful metaphor for the human condition during wartime, executed with remarkable skill, confidence and an astute fantasy feel.
rotten	It's a monstrous misfire.
rotten	One to miss.
rotten	If the idea is to show that war makes monsters of us all, then writer-director Tom Green can't quite seem to bring his film to say it.
rotten	A desert-set men-on-a-mission movie complete with jabbering jihadis, macho hysteria and the occasional extraterrestrial waving its tentacles in the background as if to say: 'Isn't this supposed to be about me?'
fresh	Ambitiously staged and impressively shot, Monsters: Dark Continent makes a bold stab at mounting a franchise but lacks the vision and surprise of its predecessor.
rotten	Suffers from a terrible case of cinematic aphasia. Clearly thinks it's saying something important and deep, but makes no damn sense at all.
rotten	The CGI effects are sensational, teaming with the beautiful, landscape-rich cinematography to create some stunning imagery. It's a shame it feels underutilized with this script full of war cliches and unsympathetic characters.
rotten	Although Edwards is onboard for the new "Monsters: Dark Continent" as an executive producer, the sequel bears no resemblance to his original, thematically or stylistically.
rotten	...the film turns into something along the lines of American Alien-Sniper, but without the endlessly arguable ethical ambiguity.
rotten	Actually has more in common with a film like Jarhead, and that's not a compliment
rotten	Plays like a dorm-room answer to modern war films, complete with the constant profanity and masculine hysterics that pass for impact in an immature script.
rotten	It's taxing to watch, and Green moves between scenes with Malick-inspired ellipses, frustrating momentum.
fresh	Whatever the filmmakers' subtextual intentions may be, the film certainly gets stronger and more compelling as it goes on, thanks in part to intense emoting on the part of its cast.
rotten	There are far better alien movies, war movies, and war/alien movies than Dark Continent, which never hits the marks of its 2010 predecessor.
fresh	This works as a standalone picture with its own distinctive take on alien invasion but also expands what now seem like a franchise with potential to deliver more and varied snapshots of human behaviour in extreme circumstances.
rotten	A crushing disappointment that's more war drama than monster movie, inexplicably distancing its main attractions from the narrative and letting dull, derivative characters spew even duller, more derivative cliches in place of any discernible story.
rotten	A wildly unpleasant and uneven picture, working to diminish the pieces of this cinematic universe, not expand it like a righteous sequel should.
fresh	Very much a film of two halves.
fresh	For all of its differences Green's film at least feels like a spiritual successor to Evans', and providing you make it through the first half (it's a long one), there is still plenty to admire.
rotten	This is just every generic Middle East war movie of the last decade, with occasional monster asides and unearned stabs at PTSD pathos.
rotten	To be fair, there is a fair amount of visual spectacle, the action sequences are quite well mounted, and the last act is admittedly more interesting than what has preceded it, but honestly, by that time I was past caring.
rotten	Plot and character development are ultimately as redundant as the monsters themselves.
rotten	A frustrating, disappointing follow-up to Gareth Edwards' left-field, low-budget game-changer, that's more Battle: Los Angeles than Aliens. And who left the aliens out?
rotten	"Monsters: Dark Continent" is a sour, tedious, and derivative film that doesn't just prove disappointing in its own right, it actively makes us resent the first film retroactively for inspiring it.
rotten	Green apes the kinetic visual style of Kathryn Bigelow and Paul Greengrass when the bullets start to spray, but when those involved are cliche-spouting obnoxious "ooh-rah!" grunts you're never going to care when they get ripped to shreds.
rotten	Not so much a sequel as another stultifying character drama set in a world overrun by aliens ...
rotten	A neo-Hitchcockian turducken of slapdash, would-be intrigue, Private Number is the sort of film that would rather accept all manner of ridicule rather than be accused of being boring.
rotten	The film feels like scenes from different screenplays cobbled together without the rough edges polished off.
rotten	Let it go to voice mail.
fresh	The fundamentally episodic nature of the narrative limits its impact somewhat, but Boorman again finds a spark in a frisky coming-of-age story that tracks the growing pains of an entire nation.
fresh	A wartime comedy of manners, it's a delightfully whimsical portrait of 1952 England, a time and place of class discord that's both uproarious and politically pointed.
rotten	It's not hopeless, but it's surprisingly slack, unfocused work from Boorman, who aims for a scattered tonality that reflects the madness of the moment, but mostly loses his way.
rotten	I wasn't especially amused by the anecdotal plot.
fresh	Once again Boorman has tapped into a particular sort of nostalgia that his audience truly feels, even if the experiences of his characters are nothing like their own.
fresh	The movie is a sweet-natured, easy-going bit of storytelling, and while Bill may be the central character, Queen and Country is really a movie about England. And it's a love letter to a particular time and place
rotten	The actual antics feel as tonally dated as the story, school-boyish shtick that went corny even before M*A*S*H married screwball shenanigans to wartime bleakness.
fresh	The director gets all the period detail exactly right and there are plenty of historical and cultural references that evoke a sense of nostalgia.
fresh	Queen and Country finds exhilarating comedy in places usually reserved for drama, violence, loss.
fresh	In short, [you may realize] how expert presentation can draw you into a world, immerse you in the lives of others, and make you sorry to leave when it's over.
fresh	Boorman is 82; "Queen and Country" is being called his final film in a career that included "Point Blank," "Deliverance" and "Excalibur." If this really is it, congratulations -- and regrets that Bill Rohan didn't appear in a few more movies.
rotten	A little too silly to be taken seriously, yet also too heavy to get all the laughs it very clearly craves, "Queen and Country" at least shows where Boorman's schizoid, if less than wholly satisfying, sense of storytelling comes from.
fresh	It's solid, albeit generic, filmmaking that satisfies mostly in fits and starts. In other words, this time there's less hope and even less glory.
fresh	There's no way around the fact that this is a lesser endeavor than "Hope and Glory," but when it's good, which is often enough, "Queen and Country" glows with a master storyteller's sense of memory.
fresh	A worthy follow-up to a classic.
fresh	[VIDEO ESSAY] Boorman's unfussy approach to his youthful past creates a warm sense of familiarity with the characters he presents, however quirky their motivations may be.
fresh	A welcome, thoroughly enjoyable follow up (to "Hope & Glory'). John Boorman hasn't lost his touch for finding humor and even wonder in the seemingly mundane experiences of life.
fresh	Boorman returns to the classical style of the movies he enjoyed at a young age, again showing his flexibility and commitment to finding a story's ideal tone.
fresh	Charming but mature post-WWII coming-of-age drama.
fresh	Barely passes muster
rotten	Boorman's point of view and on-screen alter ego seemed stylistically in sync in the first film, but "Queen & Country" - though often charming - has a tendency to wander and strain, which might say enough about capturing '50s England.
fresh	It's never going to be more than a footnote to the far superior Hope and Glory, but sometimes, when you're feeling nostalgic it can be fun to dig out the other, less interesting photo album.
fresh	Will John Boorman turn his pair of [personal] films into a trilogy?
fresh	Sturdy, moving, nostalgic in a good way.
fresh	It has taken John Boorman almost three decades to make the sequel to his much-cherished "Hope and Glory," but "Queen and Country" turns out to be well worth the wait.
fresh	To watch "Queen and Country" is to get the impression of a man who has gone through life and actually learned something, which not everyone does.
fresh	Filmmaker Boorman's stroll down memory lane does not bowl us over with rapid-fire hilarity. It soothes us and then melts away unobtrusively.
rotten	Tonally, the movie can't decide whether it's a comedy, a romance, or a wistful wartime madeleine. What it's missing is the sense of joy and wonder of its predecessor.
fresh	I hope Boorman follows through and makes a trilogy.
rotten	Queen and Country reveals itself as a prime example of the stale storytelling and ignorant ideologies audiences waved good riddance to years ago.
fresh	For a movie shaped by the harsher mercies of martial pursuits, it's incredibly light and frequently hilarious.
rotten	Rambling and unfocused but not without its moments, John Boorman's 19th feature film, Queen and Country, represents a very belated sequel to the director's 1987 feature Hope and Glory.
fresh	Queen and Country is the film of an old master (Boorman directed his first feature in 1965) who still has one of the most magical eyes in the business.
fresh	Far from a searing drama yet seldom takes the glib way out.
fresh	The strength of Boorman's film is that it reminds us of what a service comedy is-the spectacle of cogs rising up against their machine.
fresh	It works, but not entirely.
fresh	A direct sequel to 1987's Hope and Glory -- and the best thing that John Boorman has made since.
fresh	Modest but still disarming ...
fresh	Boorman skillfully takes major historical events and filters them through small, personal moments.
fresh	...a light, nostalgic military coming of age story with mournful undercurrents. While the film may feel slight compared to its precursor, Boorman deftly manages shifting tones while preserving post-war memories in a very specific time and place.
fresh	Not as engaging as 'Hope and Glory' but more deceptive in its modesty.
fresh	A deeply personal memoir, so well written and carefully observed that it draws the viewer into the ambience of postwar England with a persuasive power that makes you feel you're part of the same experience.
fresh	For cinephiles who've followed this 82-year-old British filmmaker's long and sometimes eccentric career with interest and admiration, "Queen and Country" will be a sure winner.
fresh	Queen and Country is a truly entertaining flick forged by a master storyteller and the acting is polished, even in the smaller roles.
fresh	A lovely movie, as achingly bittersweet as all nostalgia, marked by surprising moments of commonplace beauty - a brilliant morning sky, a gently burbling Thames - and real rough emotion.
fresh	A perfectly enjoyable service comedy, playing like a defanged British version of M*A*S*H that never actually gets to Korea.
fresh	Sweeping, witty, delightful and charming while brimming with warmth and humanism.
rotten	Boorman's movie oozes fond memories but doesn't quite know how to make them relevant.
fresh	One of a handful of great movies that look at World War II through the eyes of a child, "Hope and Glory" is distinguished by mischievous good humor and by the unashamed acknowledgment that war can be fun as well as horrible.
fresh	A sequel to Hope and Glory set in postwar England that proves to be an impressive coda to English writer/director John Boorman's illustrious career.
rotten	The film lacks an ability to construct significant instances of character drama as symbolic of larger concerns pertaining to nationalist dilemmas.
fresh	While it took 27 years between films, Queen and Country proves to be a lovely counterpoint to Hope and Glory.
fresh	Once more unto the breach for writer-director John Boorman, who revisits the semiautobiographical characters from his superb WWII dramedy Hope and Glory in the beautifully bittersweet Queen and Country.
fresh	entertaining enough, but military hi-jinx and romance are just not nearly as fresh a premise as was his sense-of-wonder-view of World War II through the eyes of a boy.
fresh	Boorman grasps this opportunity in a war movie, to mount an incidental battle of his own internally against a national belief system without a soul - ridiculing a military hierarchy ranging from nasty to nonsensical, and pulled off with malevolent glee.
rotten	With a wildly inconsistent tone, this makes for an emotionally disengaging film that is ultimately rather unfulfilling.
fresh	Queen & Country is hardly reinventing the wheel, but it's charming, evocative and...well-performed...
fresh	Boorman has not lost his skill for deploying actors well.
fresh	Queen and Country is an entertaining and sympathetic guide to a lost world: a rite of passage that Britain was to find it could do without.
fresh	John Boorman's sequel to his masterful 'Hope and Glory' doesn't equal its predecessor, but still offers a vivid snapshot of Army and family life in post-War England.
fresh	Admittedly modest, but the epitome of jolly, this is like the companionable second volume of an autobiography in film form - you'll whip through it in no time, and come out wanting more.
fresh	Queen And Country is a fitting, intimate curtain call on a long and a hugely dynamic and influential film career.
fresh	Once blood starts spurting and the old pros take control of the show, Patino's clever plotting wins viewers over.
rotten	Admirers of small-town gamesmanship when it comes to murder will likely be the most entertained, but even the most patient with Matt Shakman's movie might find their attention wandering away while the film struggles to sustain suspense.
rotten	Quite apart from the equally apparent lack of the Coens's extraordinary visual acuity, Cut Bank comes up short because it simply presumes that guilt and evil already live in town, just waiting for us to arrive and see the show.
rotten	This is one script that no doubt read a lot better than it was ever going to look or sound.
rotten	Deficient in charisma, Hemsworth lacks both the grit and grin that his complicated role demands.
rotten	In this sort of film, plenty of characters hope to get out of their small-time town, while viewers hope to get out of the theater.
rotten	Like many of its brethren, the movie seems to love itself while hating its characters.
rotten	Less 'Fargo Lite' than 'Fargo Flat'...a thoroughly pedestrian stroll through Coen brothers territory.
rotten	Works mainly as a throwback to those off-brand knock-offs that cluttered video store shelves in the mid-'90s. Good news, I guess, if you're nostalgic for Keys to Tulsa, Clay Pigeons or Feeling Minnesota.
fresh	It could have been so much more, and maybe that's its greatest flaw.
fresh	An entertaining but slow-paced thriller about fraud and murder in a small town.
rotten	Just a generic exercise in pulp fiction.
fresh	Cut Bank has a clever premise and a cast that works hard to make it worthwhile to stick with the film through the clunky parts.
rotten	While there's some undeniably inherent joy in just seeing some of these great actors play off each other, the sum here is a shockingly dull affair, almost made more disappointing by the talent it wastes.
rotten	Shakman is clearly going for a dark and bloody Fargo-style crime thriller, but the biggest crime in the film is just how derivative it all feels.
rotten	Predictable thriller has lots of violence, some swearing.
rotten	Patino's flights of high-flown language are both tasty and distracting; Dern, in ultra-crusty mode, makes the most of a crucial tirade. If only anything felt at stake in this story's dark spiral.
fresh	While the scaffolding of the films feel half-finished, great actors can make material much worse than this still worth watching. And while that might sound like faint praise, it's better than no praise at all.
rotten	The central problem with "Cut Bank" is a screenplay by Roberto Patino that never achieves comic liftoff despite an abundance of facetious humor.
rotten	Violent and on-the-edge of funny, "Fargo Lite," right up to the end, where the wheels come off.
fresh	This Bizarro-universe Coen brothers mash-up has the decency to be sporadically fun, even when it isn't especially original or steady.
rotten	[John Malkovich's] performance reminds us that good acting transcends mediocre material.
fresh	Without his usual tics, Malkovich is a wonder, quietly transforming an unassuming town fixture into Cut Bank's conscience.
rotten	Clever enough to provoke a few abrupt laughs along the way, this big screen debut for two television stalwarts... is sabotaged by some frightfully on-the-nose expository dialogue and an adamantly prosaic visual style.
rotten	It's difficult to discern if the missteps here were inherent in Roberto Patino's script (which made the 2009 Black List) or arise from less-than-ideal execution of the material.
fresh	Cut Bank is an entertaining enough movie with a good cast who mostly perform well. It just isn't the groundbreaking genre-buster its makers apparently think it is.
fresh	Cut Bank is well told with a different twist.
rotten	If the film is meant only as a pulpy genre exercise, Matt Shakman's competence in various modes actually works to strip it of any sense of coherent vision.
rotten	While Cut Bank has its clever moments, funny running gags, and a few shocking death scenes, it's just too expository and derivative; what's more, it takes itself far too seriously.
fresh	Generic yet entertaining...
rotten	A pile of knockoff flourishes which adds up to to a lot of manure in the fields of Montana.
rotten	If it be fated that every state eventually gets a Fargo knockoff to call its own, Montana will be disappointed that there's turned out to be as bloodless as Cut Bank.
rotten	"Cut Bank" fades into the background while its veteran actors look for ways to keep interested.
fresh	It leaves behind a nagging feeling, a suggestion there's more to the story than its story.
fresh	Despite a slow start and jarring narration, "3 Hearts" entertains with its melodramatic amour fou.
rotten	A tasteful, mildly intriguing romantic drama from writer-director Benoit Jacquot.
rotten	The premise is ripe for potent melodrama, but director Jacquot (who gets co-screenwriting credit) ultimately doesn't finesse the situation.
fresh	3 Hearts" brings together an all-star team of French actresses in a movie about a love triangle that could not be more French unless everyone smoked more.
fresh	A French romantic drama directed as though it were a thriller.
fresh	Deneuve presides over everything as the regal head of the family and national treasure of her country. She's reserved, acting more with her eyes, taking everything in.
rotten	If your plot can be resolved by having the characters share a bottle of wine and say, "You know, funny story..." there had better be a damn good reason why that conversation isn't happening.
fresh	...well-paced...outstanding acting...exceptional cinematography. This is one movie that ends when it should...leaving one thinking.
fresh	The overwrought plot mechanics are exasperating, but the lead actresses' exquisitely modulated performances get under the skin.
fresh	A chance encounter, a missed rendezvous, a marriage and a torrid affair make for an intoxicating mix.
rotten	A few plunging camera moves and careful framings, and the appealing presence of skillful actors, don't compensate for the lazy lack of psychological or symbolic imagination.
fresh	A romantic drama with the sensibility of a thriller, Benoit Jacquot's 3 Hearts is a good example of how a talented director and cast can elevate the most tired of concepts.
fresh	Aside from the lead actresses' performances, what drives the movie is energetic, elliptical storytelling and humorous asides.
rotten	The screenplay relies on so many mechanical contrivances to make the story gripping that you can hear the rusty machinery clanking.
rotten	3 Hearts just doesn't make sense-either as story or career move.
fresh	Throughout, Benoit Jacquot never loses sight of the primordial compulsions that drive feelings and expressions of great love and beauty.
fresh	Charged by dynamite performances and Bruni Coulais's ominous score, this romantic tragedy is more gripping than most thrillers.
fresh	[Mastroianni and Gainsbourg] make for believable sisters who clearly adore each other.
fresh	Jacquot makes it much more compelling to watch his characters fall in love than it is to see them writhe and twist amid its complications.
fresh	Gainsbourg - intuitive, wispily evanescent but strong - is the movie's pulsating impulse, even off-screen.
rotten	The maddening melodrama, 3 Hearts, beggars belief with the amount of combined coincidence, contrivance, and character idiocy required to keep the plot from collapsing.
fresh	A well-acted French film about the seventh sense of heart intelligence
fresh	A romance that leaves all principals heartbroken, as we in the audience will be as well.
fresh	The story line speeds by, with jumps in time and priorities, if not logic.
fresh	Those willing to invest in the lives of these characters, even if the framework around them directly and without apology guides them toward inevitable tragedy, they will experience a drama of deep, genuine feeling.
rotten	The overwrought script strains to be hip and clever and instead winds up smug and exhausting.
rotten	A tale of mistaken killers and coincidence becomes tediously tangled in Kriv Stenders's Kill Me Three Times, a suicidal experiment with narrative.
rotten	This film is full of missed opportunities, regrets, and bad decisions, and I'm not just talking about the characters in this half-cocked story.
fresh	Despite the derivative nature of the film, there are still things to enjoy.
rotten	Just standard-issue creeps going through their various nefarious motions, wasting a host of good actors in the process.
rotten	Kriv Stenders has assembled a talented cast, all of whom make for engaging scenes, taken one at a time; sadly, screenwriter James McFarland has given them a plot so joylessly convoluted that they're left floundering.
rotten	Everything you need to know about the atrocious Australian crime thriller "Kill Me Times" can be summed up in a guitar riff.
rotten	How do you cast Simon Pegg in a movie and then do virtually nothing with him?
rotten	All participants could have gotten up to something far more enjoyable.
rotten	"Kill Me Three Times" has the right idea, but it's missing some crucial levels of escalation, often caught playing cute when it should be downright evil.
rotten	Not a great film. Or particularly good. In fact, it's fairly bad as B-movies go.
rotten	The director, Kriv Stenders, arranges bodies in spaces without distinction, but he does show a curious fondness for shots of moving cars. It's an image he returns to so many times that you wonder if he was as eager to get out of here as you are.
rotten	It's got a terrific cast and a quirky sensibility to it, but there's something that feels like a misfire. The movie tries to straddle the line between R-rated violent crime thriller and dark comedy, and as such, doesn't quite succeed at either.
rotten	"Kill Me Three Times" works overtime to seem unique and clever. The result, however, is a derivative, gimmicky, at times dizzying puzzle that fails to engage.
rotten	Pegg's a pleasure, but elsewhere "Kill Me Three Times" is never as clever as it wants to be.
rotten	An Australian crime yarn with a solid cast and tone, but not enough freshness - or enough of Pegg's waggishness - to be memorable.
fresh	"Kill Me Three Times" is a true ensemble film that gives all of its many characters equal shrift in a comic book way, with Simon Pegg's Charlie the glue that binds the stories.
rotten	...despite an interestingly assembled cast and the unique location of Eagles Nest, Australia, Stenders' film is akin to watching someone move chess pieces around a board.
rotten	The film isn't enough fun to recommend on its own terms, with its sloppy construction and so little in the way of stylistic flourishes.
rotten	This Australian movie reminds you what can happen when directors pretend to be Quentin Tarantino, complete with snark masquerading as style, slippery timelines, blood and guts and guns everywhere.
rotten	In his latest film, Kill Me Three Times, Pegg plays hitman Charlie Wolfe, a character who's neither menacing nor mercurial; he's just boring -- and that's a crime.
rotten	If anything this is a sad drama about [Simon Pegg] struggling to fun up a Tarantino knockoff that's arrived 20 years too late.
rotten	The story line moves ahead, backward and sideways in three separate chapters that generally set up enough surprises to give viewers, and the characters, banana-peel concussions.
rotten	Although "Kill Me Three Times" includes a few murders, it does nothing to justify its title. Mostly, it just shoots itself in the foot, over and over.
rotten	It's nice to see Pegg stretch a little and play the bad guy. Too bad "Kill Me Three Times" doesn't give him better material.
rotten	Kill Me Three Times had the potential to be better, [but] it never once makes good on that promise.
rotten	It's too listless to even qualify as a proper Tarantino knockoff, and each faux-retro strum on the soundtrack starts to feel like a burden.
rotten	Taped onto VHS, Kill Me Three Times could pass for a forgotten Pulp Fiction knockoff
rotten	Kriv Stenders's film is unashamed to resurrect the laziest tropes of the Tarantino rip-offs that once clogged the shelves of every Blockbuster in the land.
rotten	Although it picks up a bit of steam in the third act, the film will feel like a waste of time much earlier in the runtime.
rotten	The film fails to engage the audience in the action onscreen, and [its] laughs aren't jolly enough to compensate.
rotten	Neither particularly funny nor especially clever, Kill Me Three Times is mostly just nasty.
rotten	This is the kind of flick that you can catch on Netflix and maybe find a few moments to entertain yourself, but nothing more.
fresh	Amusing, a bit on-the-nose and self-consciously clever, but it never outsmarts itself
rotten	The affectionate humanism that typically laces Simon Pegg's postmodern self-awareness is missing from Kriv Stenders's film.
rotten	A circle of lowlifes gradually kill one another off to no great effect in the dull and woebegone comic noir Kill Me Three Times.
fresh	It doesn't play things overly grim or dark or act like this is about something deeper. It's a game, and a well-played one.
rotten	One feels that Stenders tried to create an Australian version of a Quentin Tarantino film while forgetting to add the snappy dialogue or the colourful characters.
rotten	Feels like poser noir all the way, never achieving the darkly comic flair or freshness of style needed to sell its fatalistic twists.
rotten	From the electric guitar on the soundtrack to the predictable duplicitous nature of practically every single character, "Kill Me Three Times" kills all the fun by the time you reach the halfway point.
rotten	Maybe if McFarland, or director Kriv Stenders had tried to make Kill Me Three Times half as interesting as King cast it, you wouldn't watch it feeling bored, bored, bored the whole time.
rotten	Squanders a talented cast, sharp visuals and spectacular locations on a grisly trail of mayhem that rarely yields much mirth.
rotten	Cue 90 minutes of dutiful twisting and turning, crossing and bloody double-crossing, but not one moment of actual surprise.
rotten	An Aussie crime caper that's full of familiar faces plays a familiar humdrum tune. And also an atrocious score.
fresh	This slapdash but endearing doc about the rise, fall and resurrection of '80s pop outfit Spandau Ballet is an inside job, packed with strong archive footage yet lacking anything you'd call truly incisive.
fresh	Standard issue band history doc, but it smartly finds depth in a particularly shallow era in pop.
rotten	The band wasn't that great. Neither is the movie, which, if directed with a bit more sensitivity toward the latent comedy, could have been hilarious.
rotten	You won't be convinced that Spandau Ballet was the best band of the 1980s. Even if they did have the best bums.
fresh	It helps to be a Spandau fan, of course, but the smart, layered contextualizing and historicizing of the group within the film makes it a gift for any pop-culture aficionado.
fresh	The advantage to Hencken's approach is that it makes Soul Boys Of The Western World play like a movie version of a printed oral history.
fresh	[Soul Boys] does a fantastic job explaining the youth movement that birthed the New Romantic genre.
rotten	A heady recap of Spandau Ballet's rise that becomes less insightful in tracking the group's demise and eventual comeback.
fresh	An absorbing and insightful delve into how the band defined the post-punk -- and consciously flamboyant UK -- music scene and went on to be an international phenomenon.
fresh	TV-style and desperately in need of cutting, "Soul Boys" does convincingly position its subjects as key trendsetters, and their most memorable tunes continue to be enjoyable.
fresh	[Hencken] makes a very persuasive case for Spandau Ballet's place in the Britpop pantheon.
fresh	This trawl through the band's history has enough guile and guts to keep you watching.
fresh	The salad days thrill; after the rush has gone, the comedown is surprisingly moving.
fresh	Only deep-seated musical snobbery would hinder enjoyment of this definitive, authorised, fastidious,and perhaps overlong telling of the Spandau Ballet story ...
rotten	Fans of the band will undoubtedly love the package, which puts the group front and centre.
fresh	A funny, absorbing, trivia-filled portrait of friendship, the '80s music biz and bad hair.
fresh	Mr. Nossiter's main point is that traditional farming methods have become revolutionary in a country that, we're told, has grown progressively less agrarian. Mr. Nossiter champions that activism in this mellow, unfocused film.
rotten	Serena reaches its risible zenith when George confronts a Carolina panther. No, it's not Cam Newton, but such an illogical cameo wouldn't have made the movie any more of a mess.
rotten	Would be a slog no matter who the actors are.
rotten	Absolutely nothing works. No one seems to understand the place or the people. And the only thing gleaned from the lumber industry is that you can build an entire movie from performances made of wood.
rotten	If the worst you can say about a movie is that it's not very involving, that's hardly a disaster.
rotten	Violent, mature Depression drama wastes strong cast.
rotten	Stilted and strange, Serena probably looked great on paper. It also probably should have stayed there.
rotten	A Ron Rash novel praised as 'nightmarish' becomes the stuff of middlebrow melodrama in this lushly atmospheric but surprisingly calcified tale of greed, lust, murder, fire, trained eagles, wild panthers, ax wounds and incipient environmentalism.
rotten	One of Hollywood's hottest screen couples lumbers through a lumbering lumber epic that saws only zzz's.
rotten	'Serena' may be an overwrought and sometimes jumbled melodrama, but it's also a visual treat.
rotten	Despite their collaborations together, Cooper and Lawrence manage to have next to no chemistry.
fresh	This is a winner, an atmospheric thriller with terrific performances and outstanding production values.
rotten	Thankfully for Cooper, Lawrence and even Bier, their reputations will outlast Serena's legacy -- because no one will see it.
rotten	Winds up sawing logs...instead of locating hard truths of the human condition, Serena lumbers through the motions.
rotten	In other words, a lot of people realized they had an epic clunker on their hands.
rotten	Given these unpromising circumstances, I was expecting something truly awful, and perhaps that might have been more fun to watch than this lugubrious period piece. The production values and the costumes are the true stars.
rotten	...a period story of unwed motherhood, barrenness, betrayal and murder whose animal symbolism (an eagle, a rattlesnake and a panther) is more fleshed out than its characters.
rotten	Cooper is game but not fierce or conflicted enough; Lawrence doesn't get deep enough to pull anyone along on her spiral into madness.
rotten	A flat-out disaster, the kind of film that its cast and crew hope gets buried as quickly as possible as they race to move on to other projects.
rotten	What is probably the largest issue is that in trying to create an intense period drama, these collaborators succeeded instead in making melodrama.
rotten	[B]ehind the lethargic momentum and lackadaisical performances, we can almost hear [the material] crying out for someone involved to put some gusto into it.
rotten	The actors don't just look uncomfortable in their period duds, they also look uneasy in their own skins, which is a feat for two such natural, physically confident screen performers.
rotten	Serena is soon to wind up on someone's list of "worst book-to-movie adaptations." Count on it.
fresh	The performers are as beautiful to look at here as they are intriguing to watch.
rotten	Based on hackneyed plot complications, Serena devolves into a Lady Macbeth of the mountains ... as the film moves toward a too predictable ending.
rotten	It's reassuring, really, to be reminded that top-tier Hollywood stars can make lousy choices just like the rest of us.
rotten	What were Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence thinking? Seriously?
fresh	Funny how there are fans of Jennifer Lawrence who will never see her in "Serena." It's not her best film, but it contains one of her best performances, in a role that challenges her more than any other.
rotten	Beating a dead horse barely begins to describe the task of writing about "Serena"; it's more like playing coroner.
rotten	This here is a violent Southern soap with delusions of respectability, and it's a pity it tried to put on such fancy airs.
rotten	A more boring and less transcendent knockoff of "There Will Be Blood."
rotten	A hot leading couple, illegitimacy, a vengeful heroine, great period costumes... Why did Serena turn out so bad?
fresh	Lawrence is the hottest actress in Hollywood and she and Cooper share six Oscar nominations, and one win, between them. But "Serena" uses muscles the costars of "Silver Linings Playbook" and "American Hustle" stars don't often get to flex.
fresh	Densely packed and gorgeously expressionist, the old-fashioned tragedy is very nearly a satisfying experience despite its various shortcomings.
rotten	Although the film got stuck in editing limbo for two years, no amount of cutting could rid the project of a diseased premise. Nor is it erotic or violent enough to be an effective critique of human nature.
rotten	A major misfire...inert, stodgy and unconvincing, utterly failing to capture the chemistry that Cooper and Lawrence achieved in their work with David O. Russell.
rotten	It's painful to watch all that talent get wasted.
rotten	Left for dead since 2012, Serena would better serve its stars by burial, not resurrection.
rotten	Takes all the excitement out of murder, deception and sponge baths.
rotten	There's simply not that much to see in the performances.
rotten	"Serena" fails, but it's most certainly a noble failure.
rotten	Dropped into the Depression-era North Carolina timber business, [Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence] must wrestle with declarative dialogue that no actor could make sound natural.
rotten	Into each life some rain eventually falls, and in a bomb called Serena, golden couple Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, united for the third time onscreen, arrive soaking wet.
rotten	By making Serena ornamental, Bier diminishes her power, and Lawrence plays her as a petulant Lady Macbeth wannabe. Worse is Bradley Cooper, whose Pemberton comes off like an entitled scion, not a clear-cut timber king.
rotten	The film is haunted by a sense that something was overlooked in translation from the book.
fresh	Chock-full of melodrama and outrageous contrivances, there's no way to call Serena good, but it's one fascinating hot mess that's entertainingly trashy.
rotten	Flat. Dull. Why was this made again?
rotten	Both actors, gracefully dressed and lightly anguished, draw deep on their professional aplomb in a bid to keep a straight face; the credible, bulked-up pain that Cooper brought to "American Sniper" seems a world away.
rotten	The film can't reconcile Ron Rash's apocalyptic tenderness with its own eagerness to revel in romantic star allure.
rotten	It's puzzling to consider what went wrong with Serena, a film that on paper should have been great or at least tolerably amusing. (It is neither).
rotten	Filmed in 2012 and finally limping into theaters like a glamorous zombie, the movie has star wattage but zero emotional voltage.
rotten	The biggest problem is that it's all bones and no flesh, so busy combining all the structural elements that go into an award-winner that it has no personality of its own.
rotten	Serena is inconsequential, stilted, and likely being shoved out right now on streaming services due to Cooper and Lawrence starring in the two highest domestic grossing films of 2014.
rotten	Ah, well. All the best actors eventually get their Ishtar, right?
rotten	The choppily edited and thoroughly wooden "Serena'' fails to catch fire, even when everything literally goes up in flames. Basically, it's "Cold Mountain" without Renee Zellweger.
rotten	Like the title character, Serena eventually sheds its beautiful wrapping and reveals a twisted horror underneath, and the transformation is utterly ludicrous.
rotten	It emerges as a study in obsession that rarely engages our interest. It seems to have been a massive miscalculation, though it's worth seeing for Lawrence's confident performance as a bottle-blonde harpy, if for nothing else.
rotten	A Southern Gothic wilderness weepie with proletarian occult leanings, a masculinzed femme fatale selfie, workingclass wallpaper, and weirdly anachronistic back to future ecological activism. While filming in a Czech forest, to access cheap nonunion labor.
rotten	By the end, we barely like anyone in this smoky landscape, let alone care about what happens to them.
rotten	One of those movies that proves that the mere presence of all the right ingredients does not a happy meal make. It's all in the mixing.
fresh	The cinematic equivalent of a trashy airport novel.
rotten	A Depression-era potboiler starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence that never manages to get past the feeling of a calculated Hollywood reunion.
rotten	Some novels just shouldn't be adapted for film. Nobody sets out to make a bad movie. These two truisms come to mind in the wake of Serena.
fresh	If this is not a perfect film it's an unusually haunting one. The peculiar dramatic rhythms reflect the violence-in-tranquility of the logging business itself, with lulls allowing the shocking moments to cut all the deeper.
rotten	SERENA has entertainment value, just not likely in the way the filmmakers hoped. It's a fun film, but I don't know that I'd say it's a good one.
rotten	With limp plotting and lax performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, the long-delayed Serena is a flat period romance that should quickly be forgotten.
rotten	ON paper, Serena looks like it should be great - what could possibly go wrong? The answer is "the script".
rotten	Greed and jealousy are the key elements of this dramatic misfire from Suzanne Bier in which even the power (re)pairing of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence fails to ignite our interest.
rotten	How could reteaming Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper go wrong? In a word - Serena.
rotten	Log off.
fresh	Susanne Bier has delivered a sumptuous costume drama fronted by two talented leads who gamely throw themselves head first into a delightfully preposterous plot.
fresh	Lawrence plays her role like a virtuoso violinist; sweeping, soaring and cracking with elegiac grace.
fresh	Something appears to have gone badly wrong with Suzanne Bier's adaptation of Ron Rash's acclaimed novel of love and corruption in the South Carolina of the late 1920s.
fresh	There are enough flashes of the film it might have been to make it worth watching.
rotten	Though she doesn't sparkle much in the X-Men films, this is Lawrence's first genuinely poor performance. Not to worry. Nobody is likely to see the thing.
fresh	Serena is an undoubtedly handsome production with some beautiful cinematography from Morten Soborg.
rotten	This is a dark and primal story about love, jealousy and greed. Its problem is that the Oscar-winning director Susanne Bier doesn't know what to do with her two incongruously glamorous stars.
rotten	This logging drama is as turgid as the mud that surrounds the forest camp in 1930s North Carolina, despite the fragrant presence of Lawrence as the newlywed Serena in swell silk gowns and jodhpurs.
rotten	A very average misfire.
fresh	The film crumples with a shower of sparks into a forest fire of melodramatic absurdity, with all kinds of violent lurches and plot entanglements. But not before Lawrence has given us a performance of fierce, bladed intensity.
rotten	Like its heroine's ambitions, all it amounts to is dead wood.
rotten	A good-looking but flat period piece whose neutered telling renders its nutty narrative increasingly hard to believe and harder to care about.
rotten	Handsome production values notwithstanding, Bier's drama is all bark and largely trite.
rotten	What starts out as solid romantic melodrama - almost Golden Age of Hollywood stuff - gets so crazy so fast in so many ways.
rotten	We don't invest anything in either character, and with barely any tension, 'Serena' grabs neither head nor heart.
rotten	It is so convoluted, so bogged down by its own sense of worth, that it simply collapses under its own weight.
rotten	Commercially it looks a disaster. Artistically, if very far from a triumph, it's interesting, almost held together by its charismatic stars.
rotten	Considering the two leading roles belong to a pair of actors who share such an inherent, palpable chemistry, it's not something we truly get a sense for this in this particular endeavour.
fresh	The film is rather watchable, defined by impressive performances, striking production design and lustrous cinematography.
rotten	"Serena" isn't bad enough to be some kind of potential cult classic: it's tedious, with even the stranger moments and plot developments failing to raise the pulse.
rotten	Serena only has one key flaw: it is difficult to believe a single word of it, still less to care about these relentlessly selfish and short-sighted characters.
fresh	Bier is digging hard for something deep and yet, at the point when you should be reaching for the hankie, it's only because of so much sweaty desperation.
rotten	This is a film full of unremarkable compromises - the kind that result in a bland film rather than a bad one.
fresh	Bier's Danish-language work, usually structurally and emotionally cohesive to a fault, has rarely been this compellingly untidy.
rotten	The tone is wildly uneven and the concept ultimately feels strained at feature length.
fresh	Ryan Reynolds shines in Marjane Satrapi's surreal portrait of an American psycho.
rotten	"The Voices" has a lot going for it, but, sadly, its blend of terror and farce strikes a disingenuous chord.
fresh	A darkly funny, disarmingly weird horror-comedy.
fresh	By playing with storytelling rules, almost to the point of madness, Satrapi has elicited sympathy for the devil.
rotten	A chipper woman-hating comedy about a serial killer... that wants us to feel sorry for him? This is disgusting, repulsive, and enraging.
rotten	Swerving between pink-hued small-town satire and visceral gore, The Voices aims for the ghoulish humour of Eating Raoul or Parents - and, for the most part, misses.
fresh	The unusual mix of laughs, lunacy and a touch of melancholy ensures The Voices will stick in your head.
rotten	It's wretchedly unfunny and tonally erratic, the striking production design notwithstanding.
fresh	The film is gory, odd (with its scenes of talking animals and severed heads in fridges), horribly uneven but intermittently very funny in its own tasteless, grand-guignol fashion.
rotten	The Voices doesn't work as a comedy because it isn't funny, and it doesn't work as a thriller because it's not suspenseful, and it doesn't work as an exploration of schizophrenia, if that is what this is meant to be about, as it's not insightful.
rotten	It is an overwhelmingly dislikable film, an intensely unfunny and unscary horror-comedy about a serial killer played by Ryan Reynolds on his most irritating form.
fresh	Full-force performance form Ryan Reynolds but not as funny as it hopes it is.
fresh	At least Reynolds looks like a man finding his way to take risks once more.
fresh	Reynolds has never been more charming or spine-chilling - often simultaneously - in what is a genuinely multifaceted tragicomic performance.
rotten	Its grisly parts lack any actual suspense, digressions towards serious pathos are embarrassing, and the parts it plays for tongue-in-cheek irony lack any actual wit.
fresh	Satrapi's bold, bright and entertaining creation is laced with a pitch-black, sometimes truly sick sense of humour; it's wrong on many levels but that's also what makes it so right.
fresh	Utterly bonkers, this movie confounds any attempt to categorise it, blending comedy, romance, horror and drama to become a true one-off...
fresh	The film is simultaneously horribly gory, terrifically funny and terribly sad; a combination which could be confusing in any other hands than Satrapi's.
fresh	Think of this stylish, quirky and quite grisly feature from Marjane Satrapi as a meeting of Psycho, Dexter and Dr. Doolittle.
fresh	The movie has to be taken at face value: As a wacky and unsettling jaunt into sheer madness.
rotten	Once it's decided that anything might be unreal, there are so many more places the narrative might have gone.
fresh	Casting Ryan Reynolds as a small-town geek who has trouble getting a date may seem as pointless as taking a loving cup to a Leafs game, but the bright-eyed Canadian star makes this dark, dark comedy twinkle with offbeat appeal.
fresh	The Voices has its share of shocks, but the greatest of all may be the combination of star and director.
fresh	A deeply warped, darkly funny and thoroughly depraved horror comedy. Ryan Reynolds gives one of his best performances.
fresh	The film presents an askew world that blends bright kitsch and a pop sensibility with the main character's dark inner life. Ryan Reynolds pulls off the challenge.
fresh	Like Satrapi's other films,The Voices is stylish, striking, and lively.
rotten	It's the most likable Ryan Reynolds has been in a film in, well, forever, basically. He's not necessarily good, mind you.
fresh	A picture that shows rare bravery when confronted with ugliness, preferring to march forward into bleakness with a demented sense of humor and attention to detail.
fresh	[Ryan] Reynolds holds it all together with a fine performance, showing vulnerability, awkwardness, and a descent into madness that makes The Voices fascinating to watch.
fresh	Satrapi's visual touches, like the pink of the warehouse and Jerry's bowling alley home (with its alternate fantasy-reality decorating), are both funny and melancholy.
fresh	It's a delicate balance making us care about a deranged killer, but Reynolds succeeds with his warm-hearted, anxious performance.
rotten	This Ryan Reynolds-headlined indie strikes an uneasy balance between bloody mayhem and mirth.
rotten	The film is mostly a mess, albeit an occasionally endearing one.
fresh	I've always liked Reynolds for the most part, but he does his best work yet here in Satrapi's odd, pitch-black comedy about a man who talks to his dog and cat. And they talk back.
fresh	By the time we get to the closing singalong (with Jesus!), you'll be left wondering if [director] Satrapi's the one who's been taking Jerry's meds....a true cult item in the making.
fresh	The Voices is a dark comedy, emphasis more on dark than comedy, and it goes there. It maintains a creepy tone throughout but it's sensitive to Jerry too.
fresh	Appealing to look at, grotesque to bite into, and absolutely genius.
rotten	The big question here is why any of "The Voices," as crisply made and stylish as it is, should matter or entertain. The cold truth is that it doesn't.
rotten	Grisly but not especially suspenseful, tongue-in-cheek without any real wit, "The Voices" aims to hit the intersection of horror and comedy but tumbles into an uncanny valley of tedious creepiness.
fresh	Thirty years ago, during the height of the VHS boom, a movie like The Voices would be considered an envelope-pushing, clever cult classic
fresh	Simultaneously bizarre, humorous, disturbing and suspenseful.
rotten	Like most slasher lampoons, The Voices tries to be as bloody and creepy as flicks that take psycho-killing more seriously. This is a major waste of time in a movie that's about a half-hour longer than its setup justifies.
rotten	A few big stars working in a minor key, a bit of macabre indie-film quirk, and presto! Instant junk.
fresh	A flawed but amusing dark comedy that plays like a delightfully strange mix between Doctor Dolittle and American Psycho.
fresh	A genre-blending exploration of mental illness and murder, every one of its facets, from theme to tone to imagination, ratcheted up to the nth degree.
fresh	Satrapi's powers of invention keep you watching; so does Reynolds's remarkable range, from crybaby to butcher to dazzling song-and-dance man.
rotten	The Voices wants it all ways at once, and while its severe shifts in tone are certainly bold (and intentional), they also prevent the film from properly functioning under any genre umbrella.
fresh	Like it or not, The Voices aligns us with a murderer.
fresh	Ryan Reynolds is chillingly perfect as a nice-guy factory worker struggling with schizophrenia and murderous impulses in this tonally wild indie, which is nearly too horrifying to be funny - but not quite.
fresh	Fanciful, sweetly unbalanced and just right for the part, Mr. Reynolds gives his best performance in years.
fresh	When [Ryan Reynolds' Jerry] hacks people into crimson mush we don't get glory shots of the gore. It's just not that kind of midnight movie.
fresh	A colorful, fast-moving genre-blender, comedy and psychological thriller, workable thanks to Ryan Reynolds' nice-guy demeanor.
rotten	For most of the film's running time, one mistakes the main character's callousness for the filmmakers'.
fresh	Ryan Reynolds finally flourishes in a twisted turn ... His comic chops on full display, he chews the well-designed, color-coordinated scenery.
fresh	A seriously quirky piece of work...
fresh	The Voices is a silly, schizoid film, but for some it may be profound, reveling in its collision of ideas and tone.
fresh	The Voices is a complete and utter mess - that said, I'm glad that it exists. It would take a stickler to begrudge the world of cinema something this odd
fresh	It's a genuine delight.
fresh	This is a gripping look at mental illness as filtered through some extreme stylization.
rotten	The pic's tone is all over the place, from the bright red razor slash that underscores its opening titles to the "Amelie"-esque flights of fancy along the way.
rotten	The cast (including Reynolds) is terrific, and the direction is occasionally inspired, but in the end THE VOICES is far too morbid to work as a comedy.
fresh	Normally homicide and hilarity do not mix especially well, but The Voices...manages to do exactly that in a way where both the tension and the grisly laughs are in perfect synch.
fresh	The film's ability to go back and forth between absurdity and actual creepiness is also at least somewhat tied to Reynolds' performance, which has an air of menace mixed with its comedic simpleness.
fresh	A loopy, ghastly, funny, morbid and unforgettable 100 minutes
fresh	The bolts are loose, the belts won't fasten and Satrapi's disreputable little creepshow finally doesn't amount to a hill of beans. Maybe that's fine.
fresh	Even with the talking cat, this movie is a lot more realistic than 'Silver Linings Playbook.'
fresh	A risky mix of tones pays off in The Voices, one of the more playful, compassionate portrayals of a serial killer you're likely to see.
fresh	A wild, occasionally hilarious genre crossbreed that features a terrific performance from Ryan Reynolds.
rotten	A portrait of the Washington, D.C. punk-rock scene that's awash in affection but light on critical context.
fresh	An enlightening documentary ...
fresh	Scott Crawford's propulsive, decade-spanning chronicle of hardcore is marked by the same traits that typified the bands themselves: It's brainy, loud and tinged with a hint of insider preciousness
fresh	Fans will find the documentary's fast-paced but detail-oriented progress satisfying.
fresh	Anyone with a zest for dance will find plenty of interest here.
fresh	For arts, music and dance aficionados, "Ballet 422" is a documentary that will speak (and perhaps sing) to them.
fresh	It's filled with delicious moments, particularly for dance fans ...
rotten	The fly [on the wall] is very good at getting access...but rather less good at giving context.
fresh	Ballet 422 lacks the traditional hallmarks of most standard documentary films, eschewing talking head interviews and recurring streams of title cards crafted to hand-hold the audience through learning, and that's what makes it such a gem.
fresh	There are very few truly unguarded moments in "Ballet 422," despite its verite style, but it remains a fascinating pullback of a rarely penetrated curtain.
fresh	There are few titles and no interviews or narration. Entire scenes go by without anyone speaking. Instead, Ballet 422 is a very intimate look at the process.
fresh	For fans of dance, "Ballet 422" will produce plenty of pleasures. But as with great ballet, great movies always benefit from a little drama.
fresh	Lipes' verite camera work is first rate, but his abilities as a storyteller are virtually non-existent.
fresh	What makes Jody Lee Lipes documentary so interesting - even transfixing at times - is the fact that nothing is editorialized or explained. There are no interviews or voice-overs.
fresh	...viewing this film is like being a privileged fly on the wall who has been given access to the working processes of one of the world's greatest ballet companies.
fresh	A perfect match of form and substance ...
fresh	At its core, "Ballet 422" addresses a universal theme: The importance of having a dream, and the courage and dedication to make it come true.
rotten	Aside from the time constraint, there isn't much tension here, or much insight into the creative process.
fresh	...offers many insights into what goes on behind the scenes, but it presents an environment with minimal conflict and a ballet seen in sketches.
fresh	The result is a graceful sketch pad of a movie about how the strenuousness of creating art can sometimes yield riches that look light as a feather.
fresh	As a performance procedural, the film contains necessary dramatic thrust and abounds with engrossing detail.
fresh	Dance fans will love behind-the-scenes look at ballet.
fresh	An intimate and unusual behind-the-scenes look at the creation of a ballet, it may sound rarefied but has enough moments of truth and beauty to engage general audiences.
fresh	The film conveys the magnitude of these efforts with low angles and tight close-ups, giving a full picture of the challenges in a dance spectacle coming together.
fresh	The members of the team creating Peck's ballet are master illusionists. But they're also people with jobs, and the movie does an excellent job of showing the commonplace workaday atmosphere that is, in fact, a big part of that business we call show.
rotten	by paying only glancing attention to the content, and focusing almost exclusively on the process itself, the films risks trivializing the whole entity
fresh	"Ballet 422" is short, vigorous and charming. It's also purposefully superficial, holding a mirror up to the creative process rather than attempting to penetrate its mysteries.
fresh	Where's the excitement? It's there for those of us who love good movies about the process of collaborative work done for the love of it.
fresh	A delightfully immersive look at how a ballet is created, Jody Lee Lipes' documentary is a stark contrast to the psycho theatrics of something like "Black Swan."
fresh	A documentary providing ample evidence of ballet as art form that puts on display the breathtaking beauty of bodies in motion.
fresh	It's rare that movies capture the cumulative toil of the creative process as profoundly as Ballet 422, and the lack of any end-result elation forces some tough, resonant questions with no easy answers.
rotten	For dance fans, any glimpse of the New York City Ballet's inner workings is welcome. Ultimately, though, this observational documentary from Jody Lee Lipes feels too much like an exercise in form over function.
fresh	Peck doesn't come across as confident in what he's trying to do; if anything, it's his tentativeness that makes Ballet 422 so subtly dramatic.
fresh	Jody Lee Lipes' delightful ballet documentary delves into the intricacies of the creative process.
fresh	Ballet 422 is more visually sumptuous than most narratives you're likely to see this year, featuring careful compositions that make watching the film an aesthetic experience as much as an intellectual one.
rotten	Pretty, but totally devoid of drama, tension or anything that would make this behind-the-scenes peek "cinematic."
fresh	How do ballet dancers get to Lincoln Center? Practice, practice, practice, and this inside look at two months of rehearsals for a newly minted ballet is an eye-opener. Big plus for a doc: there are no talking heads.
fresh	Jody Lee Lipes shapes the footage into an intimate symphony of poetically shaped bodies that contrast poignantly with uncertain faces.
fresh	'Ballet 422' charts the production of a ballet from the mind of the choreographer to the premiere, drawing its beauty from the little details of rehearsal and preparation over the obvious glories of opening night.
fresh	Besides potentially leaving you with the feeling you've yet to accomplish anything great in life, the documentary is a pleasant twirl through the hallowed backstage halls at Lincoln Center.
rotten	Whether you buy Travolta in this role or not, the film turns convoluted under the weight of too many subplots.
rotten	The tension between grandfather and father and son is so fabricated and baseless that the film just kind of shrugs it off, like a coat it thought it should wear because that's what all the other gritty urban crime dramas are wearing these days.
rotten	What is happening! If you check out "The Forger," you might well find yourself saying that time and again, as the entertainingly terrible performances keep piling up while the plot dares you not to chuckle at the audacity of it all.
rotten	There's about an hour's worth of story in the The Forger, a languid movie that's stretched thin to fill out the running time.
fresh	The plot is ridiculous, but as a dysfunctional crime family drama, "The Forger" has its moments. Sheridan and Plummer are much better than the film.
rotten	It never for a single moment makes a plausible case for its own existence.
rotten	In attempting to spin out its competing storylines, the crime drama "The Forger" never quite gets a handle on either one.
rotten	Occasionally a movie comes along that's such an awkward compilation of ideas it fascinates: The Forger, a Boston-set melodrama involving cancer, Impressionist art and deadbeat dads, is only about half that good.
fresh	Granted, emotionality doesn't come in handy when dealing with a heist picture. Yet, underneath the thrills and near-misses is a surprisingly robust story about a father's commitment and care.
rotten	Mr. Travolta teeters between tough-guy menace and soulful, artistic intensity, but you don't ever believe that he can paint or that he can beat up a whole squad of younger, bigger, meaner dudes.
rotten	This limply directed tale emerges as a case study of an all too familiar type of art crime: the making of bad movies.
rotten	As the film's title suggests, there is something inauthentic about it all.
rotten	Scenes generally feel underdeveloped, and transitions abrupt. A suspicion grows that this is one movie that would have fared better as miniseries.
rotten	The movie is miscast and predictable, but it's not entirely without merit.
rotten	Tragically for the film's momentum, there's no sense of drama or tension to the heist.
rotten	The art-heist plot is pretty by-the-numbers, but Travolta nearly saves it with his doomed air of paternal helplessness.
rotten	Nicolas Cage at least manages to bring the occasional jolt of electricity to disposable genre tripe like this. Travolta is practically comatose.
rotten	The Forger proves to be a completely counterfeit crime thriller.
rotten	Travolta's face looks immobile, while Plummer and Jennifer Ehle, as Cutter's estranged, strung-out wife, look out of place.
rotten	I felt a little guilty not liking John Travolta's pale imitation of a melodrama. But, as routine reduced to redundant, I got over that.
rotten	John Travolta wearily plays a master art forger who undertakes the proverbial "one last job" for the benefit of his dying son in Philip Martin's soggy, strictly by-the-numbers crime thriller.
rotten	John Travolta's Raymond Cutter doesn't forge anything during the first 40 minutes of The Forger, unless we can count his unconvincing, age-inappropriate mane of hair.
rotten	We always knew Travolta's laziness as an actor would catch up with him.
rotten	Wobbly in its intentions to deliver both heist-heavy suspense, sociological realism and a touching family drama.
rotten	A sluggish, obvious fusion of a disease-of-the-week tearjerker with a comedic family crime romp that abounds in stiflingly over-emphasized Boston-crime-movie details.
rotten	...a misguided piece of work...
rotten	Good performances can't save a bland, instantly forgettable film.
rotten	A contrived thriller that wraps a gritty Boston milieu redolent of a Dennis Lehane story around a sentimental heart, with a high-stakes art heist that belongs in a more robustly plotted Hollywood studio picture.
rotten	An unpersuasive mixture of clunky family tearjerker and lazy crime caper.
rotten	Nothing feels fresh here - not even Christopher Plummer hamming it up as a crusty-coot grandpa - and Philip Martin's routinely polished direction only underscores the cliche-composting of Richard D'Ovidio's script.
rotten	Uninspired films utilizing cinematic devices that felt old decades ago are a regrettable part of the cinematic viewing experience, and "The Forger" squarely falls into this category. Even Travolta is better than this.
fresh	Gruber's sense of a calling to tradition is a common denominator among the many deli owners we meet in this fun and interesting film, mostly stressed-out men who somehow find deep satisfaction in being part of a long history.
fresh	A delectable, artery-clogging delight...
fresh	Like a fat slab of pastrami, "Deli Man" is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food: warm, generous and made with love.
fresh	The audience gets a crash course in kreplach, pastrami and matzo-ball soup. Nothing fancy here - no tarragon top notes, says one of the interviewees - but big portions and good company.
fresh	At once a celebration and a quasi-historical analysis, it may try to stuff too much into a ninety-minute span, but...it's pretty darned tasty.
fresh	The history and heartbeat of delicatessens is a strange subject for a documentary, but "Deli Man" turns out to be a charismatic and informative journey into Jewish and foodie culture.
fresh	"Deli Man" is a delicious little concoction, a consideration of the history of the Jewish delicatessen and how it reflects Jewish culture in America.
fresh	When some staffers explain, "The rules are simple, buy good food, prepare it well, but above all be a mensch," they're pretty much describing Ziggy.
fresh	Pull up a chair and listen.
rotten	It may pass mustard, but "Deli Man" doesn't pass muster.
rotten	In balancing the more objective cultural history of delis with a personal profile, Anjou serves neither well. Perhaps he should have chosen one course or the other.
rotten	Deli Man needs more meat on its rye.
fresh	The food is heavy but the japes are light. What could have been small beer instead makes the viewer hungry and hungrier. The role of the deli in Jewish culture is also capably evoked: "You can taste the diaspora!" Ziggy exults.
fresh	...excellent...interesting story of 160 years of tradition of the Jewish delicatessen with fine interviews of connoisseurs of deli including Jerry Stiller, Alan Dershowitz, and Larry King.
fresh	[P]ickled in a nostalgic brine
fresh	When deli man Ziggy Gruber says smelling the food makes him feel like his grandpa is standing there with him, you know what he means.
rotten	This documentary goes heavy on the schmaltz, in all senses.
rotten	A fairly thin subject for a feature film, but the characters and stories have charm.
fresh	More than just a nostalgic meal at shrinking number of genuine Jewish delis in N.America, latest delicious foodie doc where restaurants illuminate ethnic/national cultures.
fresh	An unexpectedly charming documentary directed by Erik Greenberg Anjou that is warm and piquant as well as informative ...
fresh	For the most part, good food and good cheer are the order of the day here, and the chatty, old-school Ziggy serves as a reliable - and touching - tour guide.
fresh	The pleasures in this doc about Jewish delicatessens are piled high as the iconic mile-high pastrami on rye.
rotten	The film is content to portray classic "appetizing" as the work of defiant outliers-not exactly untrue, but only part of the story
fresh	Deli man, your legend will survive anything, even Houston.
fresh	Large of body and personality, Ziggy seems genuinely to have stepped across time from mid-century New York, or emerged bodily from the authenticity of an ethnic tradition.
fresh	Prepare to see a jaw-dropping experience.
fresh	In the food-film canon, it aims to the be "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" of Jewish cuisine, and if it doesn't quite reach those poetic heights, it's still an affably informative documentary.
rotten	...in...fleeting moments, Deli Man reaches far beyond the flash of a feature-length Food Network special.
fresh	You will see better documentaries this year, but none more mouth-watering
fresh	Writer-director-editor Robin Campillo has crafted an unruly yet pointed drama that should intrigue patient viewers.
fresh	The movie argues that these teens' lawless, selfish mentality is a by-product of having grown up in war-stricken countries such as Chechnya, where they lived through horrors that permanently skewed their moral compasses.
fresh	Dour, dark sexual drama about a rich, middle-aged French pervert (Olivier Rabourdin) who arranges for a rent boy to turn up to his plush apartment only to find his plans going awry.
fresh	[An] ambitious and often arresting French drama.
fresh	Campillo has fashioned an empathetic exploration of what it is to be an immigrant intertwined with an acutely original love story. This offering is clearly a highpoint of 2015 for any lover of challenging, yet immensely entertaining films.
fresh	It's a fairly straightforward home invasion set-up, but what makes writer-director Robin Campillo's sophomore feature so intriguing is how it carefully subverts expectations.
fresh	A torrid, slow-burning, yet highly combustive French drama, Eastern Boys is rife with psychological tension and inter-cultural unease.
fresh	(Writer-director Robin) Campillo's script takes several surprising turns, and the film's denouement is quite touching. The film manages to be both sexy and compassionate, which makes it all the more impressive.
fresh	Both surprisingly resonant, and something of a thrill-ride.
fresh	[Campillo] leaves us, at the end, in an appropriately ambiguous place.
fresh	Warm, emotionally resonating and quietly powerful with tender, natural performances.
fresh	Explores interlocking themes of sexuality, immigration and power dynamics with a cleareyed sensitivity and refuses to demonize even its shadiest characters.
fresh	The premise is so simple and the storytelling so uncluttered that it cannot fail to lodge in your mind.
fresh	Impressively staged and non-judgmental study of the love between a john and a young hustler is compelling but a tad too cold.
fresh	As each new chapter unravels, so do our preconceived notions of the film's characters.
fresh	By turns a frightening home-invasion drama, a tender love story and a tense hide-and-seek thriller, with far more control over these unsettling tonal slides than initially seems feasible.
fresh	Campillo thankfully refrains from offering on-the-nose explications for behavior and decisions, instead letting audiences infer psychology and motivation from on-screen behavior.
rotten	"Eastern Boys" never quite fulfills the promise of those first few minutes.
fresh	What a relief to watch this small, expert film - a pane of glass in a concrete wall - that whispers, that dares to stand still and witness ordinary human pain.
fresh	A ferocious plea for character salvation within a milieu where money and bodily affect are the raison d'etre for human existence.
fresh	The distinct ambiguity from the opening stages extends throughout this memorable piece, as we know so little about our two protagonists.
fresh	A businessman (Olivier Rabourdin) makes an assignation with a rent boy and gets more than he bargained for.
rotten	Repugnant drama about the tender relationship between a man who pays for sex and the boy he hires. At least Pretty Woman pretended to be a fairy tale.
fresh	An extremely topical theme and unpredictable characters hold the audience's attention even when this French drama takes some rather implausible turns.
fresh	The effect is more redolent of a Gus Van Sant spin on Oliver Twist, not least because of Jeanne Lapoirie's dreamy cinematography (warm orange bodies against icy blue backdrops) and Robin Campillo's lyrical editing.
fresh	Some films take a while to engage their audience. Others, like Robin Campillo's masterful Eastern Boys, grip you from the very first frame.
fresh	The term "melodrama" is rarely used as a compliment, but writer/director Robin Campillo goes some way to reclaiming it with this four-act saga that switches tone and direction with assurance.
fresh	Robin Campillo's drama is sweet and neat, as ambitious as it is gripping.
rotten	This wistful study of migration and acceptance is over-stretched and tonally awkward despite some estimable performances.
fresh	The performances are first-class throughout, with even the smallest parts undertaken with impressive intensity and commitment.
fresh	Illegal immigration, unequal relationships and gay sex are put under the microscope in this compelling and slyly urgent drama.
fresh	Fascinating and suspenseful
rotten	The Living could be something kind of interesting, if only it weren't trying so hard to emotionally goad its audience.
rotten	"The Living" presents itself as a searing genre piece about domestic violence, but it proves to be only a shell of its potential.
rotten	The Living is one of those unfortunate films ignorant of any world outside its author's head.
fresh	An effective modern day noir.
rotten	The emotional dynamics in domestic violence, for the abuser and the abused, are often too disturbing and complex to be treated as superficially as "The Living" does.
fresh	A grim, grudging-buddies splatterfest featuring a few surprising plot twists and all the fixin's for a riveting cinematic experience.
fresh	Hire a hitman, face the consequences. Cheap thrills and lots of dark surprises.
fresh	A heartwarming and superbly-acted drama that hits all the right emotional notes.
rotten	Though based on a remarkable true story, this cliched tear-jerker is barely interested in Marguerite's revolutionary teaching methods, focusing instead on the intensity of her connection to Marie.
fresh	Both [stars] have radiant smiles, illuminating every moment of understanding or empathy. Their rapport warms the movie as surely as the opening scene's sun.
fresh	Ameris keeps the film tightly focused on the relationship between the two talented actresses, occasionally drawing back to contrast Marie's turbulent early days with the beauty of the French countryside.
fresh	Rivoire is a revelation - showing what it's like to be in, and then break out of, a world of total darkness and silence.
rotten	Anyone who's seen The Miracle Worker in any form will find Marie's Story very familiar, and even perhaps a bit rote.
fresh	Slight but satisfying.
fresh	Based on a true story that's perhaps less famous than some others but just as intriguing, this serious-minded -- no Helen Keller jokes, please -- period film is nonetheless quite entertaining and, finally, moving.
fresh	Jean-Pierre Ameris' new film reads pretty much like a softer, religious version of The Miracle Worker and while never attempting to match Arthur Penn's tense dramatic punch, he prefers a far more pastoral, less methodical approach.
rotten	The film is unable to specify narrative urgency beyond a broad sense of "based on a true story" pathos that's by turns hollowly uplifting and tragic.
fresh	A remarkable spiritual drama about compassion, loving, and creative caregiving.
rotten	Comedy about overly involved mom has a little edge.
rotten	With such an onslaught of misunderstanding of what being queer means and what the gay lifestyle is, the film flounders.
rotten	Director Salome Breziner is too permissive with her star, but "Helicopter Mom" retains some heart and meaning as it struggles to breathe.
rotten	A forced comedy that mines uneasy humor from stale stereotypes.
rotten	Breziner's disjointed film is rife with storylines that go nowhere and characters that briefly appear and disappear without explanation.
fresh	An alternately humorous and sobering cautionary tale chronicling the woes of an exasperated kid smothered by a well-meaning mom in an era of omnipresent parenting.
fresh	"Days of Grace" is a potent and vigorous film. It may not illuminate the depths or explore the causes of Mexico's crisis, but it mines that crisis for memorable images and dramatic scenes.
rotten	Most of this frantic moviemaking is more disorienting than riveting.
fresh	The best Mexican splatterfest since Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia!
rotten	Eventually, the film's impressive array of formal pyrotechnics overwhelms its morals.
fresh	This is all very impressive in its scope and moral reach, and the movie, with its extensive use of handheld cameras, sweaty close-ups and violent encounters, is visually striking.
fresh	It may feel more like pulp than art house, but it still maintains its grip, bound together by a score composed by Nick Cave, among others.
fresh	So confusing (especially if you're a football dolt) that you may have trouble identifying the different narrative strands. It's still gripping.
fresh	There are characters who help to connect the stories and provide a straight line through a very twisted narrative. In its best moments this is an exciting, involving multi-story thriller.
fresh	It's a confident, well-made film that ends up in a blind alley of cynicism.
rotten	Full of colour, carnage and dramatic overkill, the film drills through your brain, destroying neurons as it goes. It's like being your own guest at an aesthetic torture gig.
rotten	So we think Mexico is an extremely violent place, but are a bit confused to be frank.
rotten	The pacing drags in the early stages, the characters are thinly sketched and the impact of the dialogue has been diluted by a shoddy subtitling job.
fresh	The dizzying narrative pings hither and thither, with first-time director Gout confidently deploying different screen ratios and film stocks to remind the audience where they are in the timeline.
rotten	Starts with a bracingly stylised snarl and ends in a muddle.
fresh	Everardo Valerio Gout directs as though he may never get another chance, throwing just about everything he can at his first feature - and quite a lot of what he throws is impressive, even if he sometimes tries just a little too hard.
fresh	Gout, a prolific short filmmaker here making his feature-length debut, shows a flair for directing actors and for creating atmospheric visual sequences, often composed of single, beautifully-soundtracked tracking shots.
fresh	This is genre filmmaking taken to its pulpiest extreme, an example of style over substance to be sure, but what style.
fresh	Amounts to a formulaic but oh-so-guilty pleasure.
fresh	A hearty Dustin Hoffman plays the head of the American Boychoir School in a heart-felt, feel-good drama.
fresh	Boychoir's formula is as old as The Ugly Duckling but Girard has revitalised it with a sublime score, a craftily mixed cast of new faces and big names, along with a setting that provides room for the occasional burst of originality.
rotten	Boychoir is nice to look at and great to listen to,but with a bit more work, it could have really hit the highnotes.
rotten	Boychoir, too, doesn't have drama so much as spaces where the drama could have been.
fresh	Boychoir soars by grace of its clear narrative, strong cast and the pure harmonious voices that can only be described as celestial
rotten	If it sounds like a Hallmark movie, that's because it is.
rotten	There's nothing wrong with being uplifting, but something less predictable would have been refreshing.
rotten	What we have is a movie that's too classy to exploit its slob-vs.-snob premise, and too dry to allow a little anarchic joy to the mix.
fresh	An imperious choirmaster (Dustin Hoffman) reluctantly takes a troubled 11-year-old (Garrett Wareing) with the voice of an angel under his wing in this delightful musical drama.
fresh	Hoffman, naturally, makes his character interesting in the way that genius actors always do. Yet the film's storytelling struggles to match his level of skill.
rotten	I almost half-enjoyed the routine drama Boychoir. But then the closing credits rolled, and so did my eyes.
fresh	As it is, Boychoir is a pleasant experience, beautiful to listen to and easy to forget.
fresh	While Boychoir leads us by the hand and presents a satisfying and extremely tidy conclusion, it could have soared a little higher had it opted for a touch more improvisation and scatter.
fresh	In the era of American Idol, it's a revelation to see a film champion the understated appeal of choral music, and to make it seem exciting in the process.
fresh	Two things elevate screenwriter Ben Ripley's otherwise average drama: the stunning choral music ... and Hoffman's wisely underplayed, brooding take on the choirmaster, Carvelle.
rotten	You might forgive Hoffman for sleepwalking through this performance, given the deadly dull and predictable proceedings. No matter - even a yawning Hoffman is a mighty presence, especially compared to the raw actors in the choir.
fresh	Stirring music and strong performances elevate Boychoir above its conventional story beats into a rather compelling drama.
fresh	This is a well made, emotionally engaging drama that captivates thanks to a likeable cast and some impressively staged performance sequences.
fresh	Dustin Hoffman coaches a group of angel-voiced young men in this feel-good, yet far-from-treacly family drama.
rotten	Thanks to a few exemplary moments of monumental acting from Dustin Hoffman, truly harmonious singing from the boys, and a graceful score by Brian Byrne, "Boychoir" is, at its best, a comfortable viewing and listening pleasure.
rotten	Requires such large amounts of suspended disbelief that one wonders if the film is principally aimed at children.
fresh	Hoffman's performance has a sadness, an unexplained loneliness, which gives this slightly diffident piece a centre of sorts, and there's a pleasing air of melancholy all round.
rotten	Dupieux's movie is all script twists, lacking both the naive wonder of the films to which he pays homage and the inventive sophistication of grand Surrealist fantasy.
fresh	Too transitory and too undemanding to be termed a mindfuck, for "Reality" minditch seems about right, and it's one you even occasionally get the pleasure of scratching.
fresh	A hilarious and increasingly disturbing series of looping, overlapping and interconnected narratives worthy of Flann O'Brien or Diderot ...
fresh	The film will only work for you if you expect it not to make sense, and enjoy jokes that go on and on and then suddenly (and repeatedly) jack-knife off a cliff or two.
fresh	For those who enjoy their brain-bleeders with a significant sense of humor, "Reality" is truly something to experience.
fresh	Each narrative fissure further thwarts meaning. The most you can ask from a movie as nullifying as this one is that it offer wit and visual panache, which it does.
rotten	Flashes of wit pop up, but the accumulation of weird incidents and fake-outs doesn't lead anywhere productive.
rotten	I can finally say that the guy who made a movie about a murderous tire may have taken cinematic absurdity one step too far.
fresh	What 'Reality"'is getting at, once its game plan can be seen, is similar to 'Rubber,' in that it too is a commentary on watching whose structure quietly breaks down how we absorb art.
fresh	A viewer can't help but take it as an artistic statement, even though nothing-not even the nods to Mulholland Dr.-suggests that Dupieux's motivated by anything more than a hankering to make something weird and funny.
rotten	[A] mind-numbingly unfunny attempt to apply slippery dream logic to filmmaking.
fresh	None of these semi-absurd tales are particularly funny, though there's some fun to be had in the film's second half trying to keep up with Dupieux's storytelling and editing skills.
fresh	The beauty of Dupieux's latest -- which some viewers may find grating -- is that it's guaranteed to leave audiences scratching their heads over which events are fact or fiction. There are no simple answers.
fresh	Take this Venice Official Selection as nothing, as fun and little more, as satire or expose or as deep-down profound, it is a film hard not to react to, either walk out on or embrace.
fresh	Quentin Dupieux has a talent for rendering otherworldly concepts banal in a manner that reflects the stymied desires of his characters.
rotten	But the biggest problem with She's Lost Control is the lack of thematic drive...
rotten	"She's Lost Control" sustains a mood of deepening alienation, but the attitude of the movie is too detached for it to be emotionally gripping, and its ending is botched.
fresh	With some shrewd and swift twists and turns, She's Lost Control [...] is part women's picture, part sex thriller.
fresh	There's a lot left unsaid in director Anja Marquardt's chilly yet intimate and thought-provoking indie drama. But what should be said loud and clear is that actress Brooke Bloom is riveting.
fresh	Marquardt leaves too much intentional ambiguity for her film to fall victim to predictability.
rotten	Too often, She's Lost Control hazily drifts from scene to scene, invested in examining the exhausted topic of what happens when a sex professional finds that the rigid boundary between work and off-duty pleasure has become uncomfortably porous.
fresh	The story of a behavioral psychologist specializing in sexual surrogacy provides insight into intriguing characters for whom professional intimacy supplants personal relationships.
rotten	Ronah's loss of control brings neither catharsis nor liberation, either to the character or to the film.
fresh	Overall, I enjoyed the film, even if, at times, it felt like watching an accident in extremely slow motion.
fresh	An astutely cold and compelling psychological drama.
fresh	The first half functions as an impressive showcase for Marquardt's formal chops, as well as for Bloom's gorgeously empathetic performance.
fresh	While smart, well acted, and shot with a vigorous chilliness, She's Lost Control shares one of that client's maladies: You try to get close to it, and it shies away, even as its subject and protagonist fascinate.
fresh	A psychological thriller about a sex therapist and her efforts to stay in control of her life.
rotten	Turns out, it's not only Ronah who eventually loses control of her emotions, but the film itself that loses control of the most interesting and provocative threads of its vision.
fresh	The movie is clearly not interested in sugarcoating or sentimentalizing WWII, even though Clement has every opportunity to do so.
fresh	[It] has gone from the exemplar of what expressive narrative filmmaking could be to something more elegiac: This is what it now rarely even dares aspire to.
fresh	Rene Clement's 1944 adaptation of Francois Boyer's novel is an exquisitely unsentimental movie about the corruptive effect of war on children.
fresh	The film has lost its initial power over time and now looks too contrived to be a masterpiece.
fresh	This touching film, winner of the Venice Festival award, draws us deeply into the secret world of haunted by death children, in post- WWII Europe where, among other "games," they build a cemetry for dead animals.
fresh	Perhaps not until Ponette in 1996 had another movie looked so closely at how death might be absorbed through the eyes of a small child.
fresh	It's difficult to fault a film that scrutinizes the veracity of childhood with such clarity.
fresh	powerful filmmaking in more ways than one, a story of innocence lost that you won't soon forget
fresh	Strange, compelling offbeat drama about a war orphan with a morbid fixation.

fresh	Alonso's films are as much about men moving through the landscape, leaving behind the rules of civilization to become lost in the wilderness.
fresh	Mortensen is meticulous and mesmerising, as a man who simply keeps going when all logic seems to be deserting his experience.
fresh	Entrancing, inventively shot and played with a wonderful sense of bizarro metaphysics
fresh	If you applauded the genre-tweaking twists of Gus Van Sant's "Gerry" and Kelly Reichardt's "Meek's Cutoff," you may have a good time (or at least an interesting one) at acclaimed Argentine director Lisandro Alonso's latest puzzler, "Jauja."
fresh	In abstract Western in which the harsh but claustrophobic beauty of the landscape is intensified by the confines of Academy ratio framing ...
fresh	All in all, a quietly magical piece of cinema, a mind-bender of the subtlest kind.
fresh	For all its evocation of the 'classical' western, Jauja also, at moments, conjures a chilled-out Alejandro Jodorowsky -- less obviously surrealistic but no less provocative in its core propositions.
fresh	Mortensen has just the right class of vacant charisma for such a gouged-out protagonist and Timo Salminen's photography bathes every image in surprising lights.
fresh	It is undoubtedly beautiful, brooding and enigmatic, with Mortensen's grizzled presence holding the attention, but quite what it all means leaves you scratching your head in puzzlement.
fresh	When Inge elopes with a soldier, Dinesen searches across the unforgiving but beautifully shot landscape, in a sort of western that turns into a surreal exploration of his existential angst, then segues to his descendants in the present day.
fresh	A quest saga whose metaphysical digressions and dream interludes will fascinate and frustrate in equal measure.
fresh	Intriguing, if opaque.
fresh	Miraculous. Blithely does its own thing, but with staggering assurance and artistry.
fresh	'Jauja' is a film to make you wonder.
fresh	Though admiring the filmmaker's innovation and inclination for minimalism, the lack of linearity and narrative structure is to the film's detriment.
fresh	Challengingly spellbinding.
fresh	Jauja may not be for everyone, but those who give it a chance will find a complex, beautiful film.
fresh	Mysteriously opaque and thrillingly spooky, Lisandro Alonso's Jauja evokes what many films aspire to yet rarely achieve: a genuine lucid state of cinema-as-dream.
fresh	In his latest feature, the breathtaking Jauja, Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso demonstrates that he is the rare filmmaker who trusts his audience enough to winnow his films down to the bone.
fresh	"Jauja" makes one cryptic leap too many at the end, but until then it evocatively confounds.
fresh	Even if director Lisandro Alonso meanders a bit, he pulls a rabbit hole out of his hat in the end ...
fresh	Alonso's audacious leaps of time, his incisive view of the wiles of combat and the rigors of survival, and his ingenious reflection of present-day splendors in past plunder lend the visually sumptuous experience a haunting depth.
fresh	The performances mesh beautifully with the filmmaking, which is more keenly attuned to fluctuations in the natural world that all but a handful of modern motion pictures.
fresh	I never once doubted that I was in the hands of a master filmmaker.
fresh	Staggeringly beautiful movie with almost no story, a representative "New Argentine Film"
fresh	Where 'Jauja' winds up is bizarre, even for an Argentine art-Western, but the move makes sense if you catch on its wavelength, a task made all the easier due to not only to its gradual, hypnotic pace but also its playful tone.
fresh	The rounded-off corners of the almost-square frames evoke early movies and antique photographs, and there is wit and mischief in the way Mr. Alonso plays with the relationship between what we see, what we don't see and what we expect to see.
fresh	The film is expansive, pushing the ideas that Alonso has probed in the past further than he has ever taken them.
fresh	At its most powerful, Jauja suggests the surreal Western violence of Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian in the way Alonso gradually folds the action into a waking nightmare.
fresh	Mortensen injects the director's esoteric, anti-psychological themes with a psychological reality that makes them all the more tantalizing.
rotten	[Jauja features] some gorgeously observed tableaus but also stretches of dry tedium, hemmed in by a layered and mannered aesthetic.
fresh	It's a movie designed for maximum intellectual appeal, even if the emotional impact is slight.
rotten	There's a line between artfully contemplative and just plain boring. This film eventually crosses it into Snoozeville.
fresh	There's so much to take in here that at times I almost felt as if I were absorbing it through my skin.
fresh	An extremely enigmatic work that dangles possible meanings before viewers, who are forced to put their thinking caps on.
fresh	Those open to other possibilities in cinematic language may marvel at Alonso's ability to hold a viewer rapt through little more than landscape, movement and sound, and ideas that emerge implicitly rather than being directly stated.
fresh	Beautiful, haunting and hypnotic, Jauja sees its own legend grow disproportionately, until we all, in our search for sense, get lost on the way.
fresh	A hallucinatory trip down the rabbit hole that summons memories of Gus Van Sant's "Gerry."
fresh	A ponderously paced but artistically sure journey; it's a film that finds strength in the universality of its ideas and its spiritual dimension, one that's enlivened by instantly iconic imagery and a keen sense of the strange.
fresh	Shot in an almost square ratio by Finland's minimalist cinematography master Timo Salminen, Jauja is a harsh, gorgeous dream that defies resolution.
fresh	Alonso's most narratively knotty film yet ...
fresh	Revisionist westerns are usually dour affairs, foregrounding guilt over the imperial legacy of runaway expansionism, but Jauja is refreshingly absurdist, consistently including shots for seemingly no reason other than to be dry punchlines.
rotten	It's a film of fussy, cultivated austerity; Alonsolytes will debate what it's hiding, while others will suggest "an actual movie" as the answer.
rotten	...we felt set adrift, marooned in a vast endless void of narrative nothingness.
rotten	With a succession of tangential flashbacks, the film gradually disengages viewers from the plot.
rotten	At the end of the day it's some neo-noir nonsense that makes those post-Tarantino movies from the mid-Nineties look like Chinatown.
rotten	While it gets credit for audacity, the film suffers from amateurish performances and ignores the ethical ramifications of its characters' behavior.
fresh	This is a comedy that encourages viewers to be impulsive, and pointedly seek love and acceptance outside of "normal" social institutions, especially when it comes to family and romance.
rotten	Mr. Borden, an acclaimed Canadian stage actor and playwright, turns in a slyly entertaining performance. But the relationship between Lake and Melvyn feels a bit more one-sided than perhaps was intended.
fresh	Gerontophilia has the authentic feel of a little classic.
rotten	Gerontophilia is rather reminiscent of a student film, and I don't mean that it has the fire of youth. It is restrained by a rank amateurism that borders on embarrassing.
rotten	There are the makings of a poignant Harold and Maude-style drama here, but the movie is so amateurish and eager to be shocking, it just winds up feeling creepy.
rotten	Katie Boland is ... a force of nature as Lake's feminist ex - who gets off on reciting the names of her favorite female revolutionaries. But neither she nor Borden can mitigate this film's ultimately creepy premise.
rotten	LaBruce ... [is] angling either for tragedy or an arch jab at the coldness of sexual conquest. I only wish he had let his conceit ripen long enough for us to tell.
rotten	Better camerawork and a lower gross-out factor than usual seem to have taken the oomph out of bad boy Bruce LaBruce, whose Gerontophilia sports a great title and a funny opening before going all limp.
rotten	It may be that, in self-consciously targeting a wider audience (as LaBruce has happily confessed was his aim here), the director's lost a little of his edge in the process.
rotten	This tonally uncertain romance is both surprisingly conventional and tame.
fresh	Gently challenging (it is the first of LaBruce's films without any sexually explicit content), beautifully shot and rather engaging at times.
fresh	The film surfs smoothly on good vibes and lulling moods; Borden, a majestic presence, deserves sterner stuff to wrangle with.
rotten	It chooses the delicateness of a fable instead of the narrative recklessness we've come to expect from Bruce La Bruce.
fresh	The cast does a good job at playing it straight; Walter Borden is surprisingly tender as the catty octogenarian who steals the young man's heart.
rotten	The film seems to be about the wrong character.
fresh	An enjoyable but surprisingly tame film about a provocative topic.
fresh	A charming, only mildly subversive addition to the director's canon.
fresh	Gerontophilia is a simple romance and a rather sweet one if you can get your head around a handsome young man and an old duffer swooning and spooning.
fresh	While Gerontophilia hints at serious issues in the way we treat our senior citizens, it keeps things light-hearted, with the high camp of Lake's uber-feminist girlfriend and his alcoholic mother providing the laughs.
fresh	Bruce LaBruce (working with co-writer Daniel Allen Cox) gets downright cuddly with this impressive, still outre romance. I'm very interested to see what reactions the film receives once it gets broader play.
rotten	Just because it's clean doesn't mean it's a good movie.
rotten	The leading man often seems more like a brooding menace in this handsomely produced but painfully slow faith-based romantic drama.
rotten	Even if you agree with Clay's rigid moral stance, you'll probably be put off by this remarkably dull, tone-deaf argument for chastity.
rotten	At least the title is accurate for this painfully wholesome romance.
rotten	OLD FASHIONED has a great deal of trouble turning its not-very-dynamic concept -- not dating -- into a watchable movie. But it also has trouble arguing its own point.
fresh	It's incredibly rare to see an American movie with a Christian perspective that's more invested in philosophizing and empathizing than in eschatological pandering, and for that alone "Old Fashioned" deserves commendation.
rotten	Disturbing is the film's apparent conviction that the surefire way to a woman's heart involves lots of candles and a mani-pedi, the sort of notion that isn't so much cute and old-fashioned as it is acutely offensive.
fresh	This low-budget, faith-based film -- with a cast of mostly unknowns -- is little more than a made-for-cable movie. But it offers an endearing look at what it's like to fall in love -- not lust.
rotten	Old Fashioned feels like a familiar work of juvenilia, something similar to those terribly insightful relationship dramas your college roommate wrote on lonely nights.
rotten	[Old Fashioned] raises some interesting questions, but in the end it's not credible.
fresh	The movie is self-conscious about its more on-the-nose aspects, which doesn't help much. It's also self-conscious about the weirdness of the world it espouses, which does.
rotten	The latest "faith-based" film set in one man's demented vision of the American heartland, and luckily it is too laughable to take seriously.
rotten	Old-fashioned is right. Like how the Taliban is old-fashioned. Behold some pretty despicable passive-aggressive othering of women in the name of 'respect.'
rotten	It must be pretty neat to make a movie that mostly consists of people telling you how chivalrous and morally right you are and how much everybody loves you, but that's no excuse for making it this boring.
rotten	Old Fashioned longs to return to the good ol' days, before the scourges of online dating and one-night stands sapped all the sweetness from modern courtship.
rotten	Hipper than your typical faith-based drama, but the romance is such chemistry-starved hokum that the movie doesn't deliver.
rotten	Old Fashioned is excruciatingly dull. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. I had to force myself to stop looking at my watch, because it was discouraging how little time had gone by whenever I checked.
rotten	Any masochistic joy that can be derived from watching the film owes to seeing it take its bullheaded conceit to its logical, artless extreme.
fresh	A refreshingly-principled parable proving that a picture championing chastity can be every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as one promoting promiscuity.
rotten	a stylish, narratively stripped-down thriller that works quite well, right up until it stumbles and falls into a terrible ending that feels both utterly contrived and morally ridiculous
fresh	... a 'Most Dangerous Game' update that benefits from spectacular terrain and decent performances ... Douglas makes up in killer sarcasm and animal cunning what he lacks in physical prowess.
rotten	Rich people shouldn't be able to get away with murder, sure, but screenwriters shouldn't be able to get away with this.
rotten	Michael Douglas does what he can to breathe life into a stale project, but he can't save the utterly predictable slope the film slides into. Beyond the Reach is about as entertaining as a severe case of heat stroke.
rotten	For a film that deals with a desolate, scorching unknown, there sure are a lot of obvious plot notes along the way.
fresh	Always absorbing and gripping.
rotten	It's lost and confused, with its baffling plot turns and character motivations presented in a straightforward, dead-eyed manner.
rotten	Ultimately, the take-away from "Beyond the Reach" is this: Don't go into the desert with a guy in a blazer. Even if he offers you a martini.
fresh	Watching Douglas behave like a narcissistic scumbag is an absolute pleasure, one in which viewers of action-adventure "Beyond the Reach" can happily indulge.
rotten	A deadly, desert-set game of cat and mouse that is tired and beyond plausibility.
rotten	"Beyond the Reach" is a grueling, unsatisfying thriller that fails the logic test in spectacular ways.
fresh	Douglas is in his element and the throwback, stylized look of the production makes Beyond the Reach an entertaining hit of escapist fun.
rotten	There's not much here: The characters are paper-thin, and the action is slow, at times agonizingly so.
fresh	Doesn't add anything to the human-hunts-a-human genre but is effectively served.
fresh	A nifty little morality play set in the Mojave Desert.
rotten	It isn't nearly as much creepy fun as it sounds like.
rotten	The film aims to puts a compelling twist on the "most dangerous game" trope, but its few good ideas are overshadowed by baffling character decisions and grating plot twists.
rotten	The title of this turgid chase drama couldn't be more apt: almost everything escapes its aim.
rotten	Michael Douglas seems to have been slithering toward this part for 40 years
rotten	There are goofy, primal pleasures to be had in the first two-thirds of the film. But "Beyond the Reach" exceeds even its humble grasp in the final act, collapsing in a clatter of blockheaded manhunter-movie cliches.
rotten	The flat-out awful ending ... deflates much of the goodwill built up by the rest of the film.
rotten	"Beyond the Reach" is a misfire, one of those movies that never quite rises to the level of guilty pleasure.
fresh	Offers a decent amount of thrills and sun-caked frustrations. Get up and leave before the final ten minutes, and the movie provides a compelling ride into disaster.
rotten	"Beyond the Reach" fails to achieve the Southwestern noir potency of "No Country for Old Men," but there's no denying it brings to mind another Southwestern classic about malicious pursuit: the Road Runner cartoons.
fresh	It provides a nice showcase for the villainous talents of Douglas.
rotten	The movie tries too hard to promise nail-crunching terror that it never really delivers.
rotten	It all goes to hell, more spectacularly than any film in recent memory. Does that ruin what was a pretty good time? It depends.
fresh	The attempted "new twists" on a classic story that's been filmed to death almost ruin it.
rotten	Money couldn't have saved "Beyond The Reach," but maybe a bit more time figuring out the right story would've been a better investment.
rotten	If all a movie needed was a boy with abs and a gun (or slingshot), then Beyond the Reach would be a masterpiece.
fresh	A potentially sophisticated conclusion is wrecked by a conventional ending.
fresh	Douglas' gleefully smarmy performance goes a long way towards perpetuating the thoroughly watchable atmosphere...
fresh	The Reach offers up happy corroboration that filmmaker Jean-Baptiste Leonetti's astonishing dystopian science fiction masterpiece Carre Blanc was no first feature fluke.
rotten	A preposterously bad, grade-Z adventure yarn in which a crazed billionaire hunter chases a skivvy-stripped guide through the Mojave Desert for upwards of 90 minutes, while the audience looks on in quiet disbelief.
rotten	A decent premise is ruined by poor execution and a ridiculous ending.
rotten	Not even a gleeful Michael Douglas can make this a cat-and-mouse game worth playing.
fresh	A unique, uniquely visual, father-son road movie, featuring a marvelous turn by the great Andy Lau.
fresh	Peng's eye as a director is more pictorial than visually adventurous, but she can underscore the urgent heart of a scene - no matter how busy - with impressive speed.
rotten	Writer-director Peng Sanyuan juxtaposes Lei's and Zeng's parallel searches with a present-day kidnapping in progress, but the clumsy attempt at interconnected stories serves only to confuse.
rotten	Confronts serious problems but is too busy reaching for epic sweep and soaring moments to nail the fine detail of main characters' fraught give-and-take.
rotten	Given the widespread and devastating situation, the movie's quaint, comforting treatment is a letdown.
fresh	Delicate and affecting, the movie is also too muted and somber to attract much box-office attention [in America].
fresh	A compelling documentary that's short on running time but long on emotion.
fresh	Why are these noble creatures being killed wholesale? For trinkets - mantelpiece knickknacks. The sheer needlessness is appalling.
fresh	Short running time leaves certain avenues unexplored; yet the overall effect is utterly heartbreaking and urgent.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron has everything fans have been waiting for. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	The Avengers return in an epic adventure with a little romance and tragedy to keep the spectacle grounded.
fresh	Age of Ultron is not disappointing but it is definitely not better the first one. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	I began to forget the breathless, teetering, tottering, careening, catapulting Avengers: The Age Of Ultron about 20 minutes into its 141 minutes... Zoom, quip, wham, smirk, quip, blam! Quip! Oh so much too-muchness on an inhumane scale.
rotten	It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?
rotten	The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore.
rotten	[The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters.
fresh	As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if they're putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine.
rotten	When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?
fresh	Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward.
fresh	Though advertised as a darker and more brooding follow-up, the real surprise of Ultron is how much in line with the first film's tone and structural beats this is.
fresh	It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human.
fresh	A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
fresh	The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that it's reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties.
fresh	It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it.
fresh	There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw.
rotten	Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
fresh	Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now.
fresh	Whedon is still Whedon, and the grace notes -- the snappy patter, the team dynamics, the "man, that was cool" moments -- go a long way.
fresh	Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.
fresh	The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball.
rotten	That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that "Ultron" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder.
fresh	The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movie's very elegant fluidity rests ...
fresh	At this point the Marvel superhero movies are as machine-tooled as a Prius, and this one sticks closely to the blueprint that's made them box office titans.
fresh	You can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first "Avengers," has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life.
fresh	With Marvel's universe expanding and intertwining at an ever increasing rate, "Age of Ultron" feels less like a sequel than a cosmic event.
fresh	Regardless, this time with Avengers: Age of Ultron, our socks were only tugged on, halfway flopping off our collective toes, but never blown quite off.
rotten	More of the same, just not as good--lots of sound and fury (along with some Fury) signifying very little.
fresh	Whedon is as interested in how the team works under stress as he is in the way pavement cracks under the collective weight of the Hulk and Stark's Hulkbuster armor.
fresh	By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms, franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs: a dollop of charm.
fresh	As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own.
fresh	"Age of Ultron" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop.
fresh	Whedon's wit and invention are considerable...[but] the movies keep getting bigger, with diminishing returns. I find myself hoping against hope that Ant-Man will be really, really small.
fresh	As he did in the first "Avengers," writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun.
fresh	Spader is so charismatic, so purely, quietly and wittily nasty, that he provides a welcome contrast to the rote wisecracking of our heroes, who are so busy trying to one-up each others' punchlines that they are beginning to come off like "Avengers' 11."
fresh	Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment.
rotten	A whole bunch of blather leads up to the same old climax with imperiled innocents and massive destruction.
fresh	Age of Ultron is a feast of visual delights, but plot wears thin. If Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), who are now taking over the Avengers series, want to keep the audience fully invested, some re-Assembly is required.
fresh	More bloated, but bolder than its predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron is every bit the 11th entry in Marvel's winning, world-dominating formula.
fresh	It's one you're going to want to see because when it shines, it shines bright, but Avengers: Age of Ultron is just a little worrying that the universe is already buckling under its own weight.
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
fresh	Huisman is charming, but it's Ford who makes this movie. Ford's been involved with so many action movies, it's easy to forget his acting talent.
fresh	Age Of Adaline rewards viewers who buy into its ludicrous premise with a frequently beautiful, occasionally stirring cinematic trinket.
rotten	The makings of an interesting movie are here, but the script, written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz, collapses on itself in the third act.
fresh	It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points. A rumination on loneliness.
fresh	Lovers of the genre will find plenty to love about the stylish Age of Adaline and may find themselves rooting through pockets for a tissue at points, a romance movie equivalent of a standing ovation.
rotten	The story itself is hardly epic and certainly isn't romantic, which makes us focus on how ludicrous the whole thing is.
rotten	Starved of sufficient comedy or drama, "The Age of Adaline" is a pipsqueak.
fresh	A surprisingly effective fable. Blake Lively is excellent.
rotten	A preposterous premise treated with great solemnity. Lively shines, though, as does Ford.
fresh	Plausibility, shmausibility. This is pretty schmaltz done right.
rotten	Someone should steal this concept and make a decent movie out of it.
rotten	"The Age of Adaline" works best as a simple story of boy meets girl; girl falls in love; girl mulls whether or not to reveal that she'll stay young forever. Everything else is just a lot of unnecessary noise.
rotten	As awkward love triangles go, this is second only to the 1989 film Chances Are, where Robert Downey Jr. discovers that in a past life, he was his girlfriend's father. (Gross.)
rotten	A middling romance intended as counter-programming before a summer of world-savers and life-takers, The Age of Adaline is an adequate way to kill a few mortal hours in the theater for romance fans.
fresh	"Adaline" Enchants Despite Lack of Chemistry
rotten	Manages to score some select moments of goodwill, but ultimately hampers itself with a severely underdeveloped story.
rotten	The story's magic realism is so torpid and affected as to make the film feel as if it, like Adaline herself, goes on forever.
fresh	Ultimately, you believe Lively as an old soul in a young body, carrying a heavy secret; you hope, somehow, that love will bring her a happy ending.
rotten	Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove, like someone just asked to kiss her hand. It might be the most sepia-toned performance I've ever seen.
fresh	This YA-style romantic fantasy could have been cringe-inducing; instead it's a serviceable fable about the importance of mortality.
rotten	For a movie that emulates literature, The Age Of Adaline never fits comfortably into a particular form-literary or cinematic.
rotten	Aims to be as timeless as its main character, but it ends up feeling like a musty relic.
rotten	If Estee Lauder made a movie, it might look a lot like The Age Of Adaline, a swooning, fawning romance about a woman who achieves what no anti-wrinkle cream has before.
fresh	A low-stakes, high-concept romance, gifted with warm cinematography and lush period trappings.
fresh	"The Age of Adaline" weaves a fantastical tale within a plausible real-world setting. Blake Lively gives a performance of remarkable depth and sensitivity.
fresh	Shameless but mostly well-executed date-night fare, but Blake Lively seems like the wrong fit for the lead.
rotten	Lively's performance is appropriately mysterious but too shallow to allow audiences to empathize with her character. The fault lies more in the screenplay, which doesn't give her character much depth.
fresh	Beautiful but shallow, but also beautiful - a spell that only breaks once you turn on your brain, which you shouldn't anyway.
fresh	Adaline is consistently gorgeous to look at-and a good reminder that love, even when it's complicated or painful or doesn't last, is a whole lot better than immortality.
fresh	Age of Adaline - while frequently preposterous - has just enough pixie dust that it ought to find a fan base among romantic types.
rotten	Less a sincerely kooky elegy to lost time than a slightly off-kilter acting out of familiar rom-com bona fides about commitment-phobes missing out on life.
fresh	Sad, wistfully romantic and featuring maybe the best performance Harrison Ford has ever given on the big screen.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a pearl of a film: intimate despite its century long scale, new and old at once, it's a small movie to discover and carry with you.
fresh	Lively is an odd screen presence - somehow both warm and cold, accessible and recessive. She's long been ripe for a breakthrough lead role that allows her to stretch and surprise.
rotten	Lively's never been better, but "Adaline" is more interested in what she's wearing than what her character's thinking.
fresh	Blake Lively's subtle, expressive performance sets the tone for this thoroughly ludicrous, thoroughly enjoyable romantic drama.
rotten	Director Lee Toland Krieger hits all the expected emotional beats but doesn't take many risks or glean sufficient insights about our fascination with the double-edged sword of eternal youth.
fresh	In what is likely to be the year's most deliriously satisfying illustration of what happens when you feed a chick flick steroids, Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) hits emotional paydirt as a turn-of-the-20th-century gal who stops ageing at 29.
fresh	Stay far away if romantic movies bother you. For everyone else, this very much delivers on its earnest intentions.
rotten	It floats, like Lively herself, in a kind of timeless bubble.
fresh	Indie darling Lee Toland Krieger has managed to pull off this high concept film with an innocent charm that harks back to Golden Age Hollywood romance.
fresh	Harrison Ford emerges as Krieger's trump card...It is a raw, vulnerable performance that ensures the film soars and draws fresh reserves out of Lively (the definition of 'Supporting Actor', surely).
fresh	Never mind that the story is far fetched, the film engages largely due to a winning central performance by Blake Lively as the ageless Adaline, who spends her life running instead of living because she fears someone will learn her secret
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
rotten	Lazy gags, and it's been done better elsewhere.
fresh	This kiddie sci-fi adaptation doesn't quite live up to its evocative title.
fresh	I brought a couple of my kids, who liked it fine and found the friendship at the center rather affecting.
rotten	The feature doesn't connect in a significant way, reduced to a series of skits, poo-poo, pee-pee jokes, and commercials for the soundtrack.
fresh	Oh and Tip may not be the most memorable animated duo, but Parsons's high-pitched squeal and the groove in Rihanna's voice bounce off each other nicely.
rotten	While watching "Home," a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
fresh	You could do a lot better in the kid-film arena than this, but you could also do a Smek of a lot worse.
rotten	DreamWorks movies are often about outsiders learning that they don't have to fit in, a lesson the filmmakers may not have absorbed themselves.
rotten	Only mildly annoying.
rotten	The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	Delivers a slick, serviceable blend of romance and melodrama. Your typical love and sacrifice and bull-riding tale.
rotten	There's little here to convince the audience of boy and girl's special chemistry, and nothing to attach the audience to them, either.
fresh	Everything is tied up in a neat moral bow, with Luke realising that the challenge of the rodeo pales next to the "longest ride" of the title, which -- I hope I'm not giving too much away -- is the ride they call life.
fresh	Though Tillman doesn't quite elevate the maudlin material into serious drama, the result is uncommonly sensitive.
rotten	Sparks' perverse need for love to be perfect-even if it takes cancer to make it happen-becomes The Longest Ride's undoing.
fresh	This is spoon-fed entertainment, but it tastes pretty good.
rotten	Even when Eastwood and Robertson, pleasant enough company, threaten to float off the screen, "The Longest Ride" glides along and delivers its reheated comfort food by the ton.
rotten	Everything in the movie is suffused by a vision of life that is resoundingly and evidently false, but as this vision is not repulsive, but is intended to reassure, the lies don't produce anger or frustration. No, they bring on the laughs.
rotten	The two-plus hours is mostly marked by an emptiness born of scene after scene designed to blatantly manipulate emotions rather than trigger them.
rotten	The Longest Ride is sentimental, forced and silly, but it's sure to hit the bull's-eye with its intended audience.
rotten	As sexy as a rodeo clown and much slower.
rotten	Fairly tedious, despite the charm and sincerity of the actors.
rotten	There's little doubt where Cormac McCarthy-bashing Sparks's allegiances lie. The Longest Ride is truly no country for old ambiguity.
rotten	A weepie that smashes together the Holocaust, bull-riding and Alan Alda, and yet still doesn't achieve cheesy transcendency.
rotten	Insipid
rotten	Qualifies as one of the best Sparks films by virtue of not including any love-ghosts or destructive misinformation about how Alzheimer's works.
fresh	Carolina settings, star-crossed lovers, elements of tragedy: Sparks' formula works. Get out your handkerchiefs, and rest assured that there will be uplift at the end.
fresh	It's easy to tease a Nicholas Sparks movie. It's harder to admit that he's good at his niche - and has a string of 10 films, nearly all profitable, to prove it
fresh	A well-told love story that starts a little formulaic but quickly turns into something that's enjoyable to watch unfold.
fresh	[Nicholas Sparks'] stories can provoke any one of us, curmudgeon or no, to shed a tear or two over the impossible dream of living in one of his fairytale universes.
fresh	The film is likely to satisfy Sparks fans. And it brings something new to the romance genre: bull riding.
rotten	This predictably sudsy screen adaptation unabashedly oozes slush and sentimentality....
rotten	It's dumb, it's long, it's dull, but it isn't quite bad enough to be camp.
rotten	Appealing performances by a trio of second- and third-generation Hollywood kids keep this three-hankie twaddle more bearable than it deserves, but "Ride" will surely go the longest with audiences for whom this is not their first Sparks rodeo.
rotten	An undistinguished romantic drama that takes few risks and offers wish-fulfilling escapism with bland dutifulness.
rotten	Just as the basic plot points are hard to swallow, even the most rudimentary aspects of the characters' interactions feel forced, artificial and unspontaneous.
fresh	Delivers romance, passion, heartbreak and surprises - beautifully. The film is an ideal chick flick, date movie and emotional tour de force for anyone who is a romantic at heart
rotten	The real love story is between Eastwood and David Tattersall's camera, which spends so much time leering over the actor's cheekbones, abs and other attributes that you begin to wonder if someone's going to call Human Resources.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
rotten	Not entirely unfunny.
fresh	Your standard Ferrell/Hart vehicle that's rarely witty enough to live up to its potential, but still delivers enough laughs for those seeking a silly comedy.
rotten	The highest praise I can give "Get Hard" is that it is not quite as awful as it could have been.
rotten	A lazy attempt to drag out a Funny or Die-style skit to feature length by continuously recycling about eight minutes worth of gags.
rotten	Expect over-the-top idiocy. Expect graphic sexual gags. Expect a lesson on the prison art of 'keistering.' And, yes, expect lots of dicey racial humor.
rotten	Will Ferrell has built his film career on being an everyman or a naif devoid of self-consciousness. In Etan Cohen's Get Hard, Ferrell goes with the latter, but adds a patina of ultra-rich entitlement.
fresh	The movie seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts.
fresh	Silly, offensive but effective.
rotten	Weighed down by endless jokes about prison rape, relentless homophobia and a bevy of absurd stereotypes, this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart film sinks into an abyss of failure.
rotten	The distasteful, often flat Get Hard succeeds only as a testament to the resilience of talent.
rotten	With Ferrell and Hart involved, it's probably impossible for anyone to completely resist their baser instincts to be amused by the patently offensive. Though it's hard not to wish more moviegoers would.
fresh	It's still ultimately a disposable work, but at least while it's going, it hits hard.
fresh	It's tricky territory to tread, and Get Hard doesn't always get it right, but in a nation where racial and economic divides are growing issues, it deserves credit for trying.
fresh	The high concept is delivered more or less efficiently: basically an incorrect and funnier version of Spike Lee's 25th Hour, with a dash of Trading Places.
rotten	The oft-repeated gags about prison rape and the frequent racial stereotypes become such a drag that solitary confinement might be a welcome break.
rotten	A movie that refuses to recognize when it's going too far, with its wince-eliciting jokes about jailhouse rape in particular.
rotten	A movie you're waiting to finish rather than anticipating the finale.
rotten	If you don't think the over-rehearsed prospect of prison rape - specifically, black-on-white prison rape - is quite enough of a comedy goldmine to sustain a whole feature, tell that to the screenwriters.
fresh	Will Ferrell is looking at ten years in the slammer in a comedy that delivers a hard slap in the face to political correctness.
fresh	If Get Hard isn't quite the biting satire that its premise would imply - though it's more unabashedly eat-the-rich than some critics have given it credit for - it's consistently ridiculous enough to be funny more often than not.
fresh	Pairing Ferrell's looming, kooky calm with Hart's pint-sized, pugnacious bluster proves a complimentary meshing, rising star Hart's incredulous observer an audience stand-in for Ferrell's boor-out-of-water style comedy.
rotten	The movie overcompensates for its lack of cleverness with an oversimplified story and an enormous amount of lowbrow humor.
rotten	Funny bits come along every now and then, and the co-stars work desperately hard for their salaries. But the spectacle is depressing for what it says of mainstream studio standards.
rotten	Here is an ounce of credit to Get Hard for avoiding any mention of the innuendo involving an inmate dropping the soap in the prison shower.
rotten	Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence.
rotten	Get Hard is just smart enough and funny enough to make you realize that with a little actual effort it might have been much more funny. But why bother writing jokes or a plot when it's easier to talk about how much anal rape goes on in prison?
rotten	'Get Hard' might be the perfect flick to show at your next frat party at the University of Oklahoma.
rotten	All the comedic and visual elan of an amateur YouTube fratboy prank, include nonstop rape jokes and rampant homophobia. Are you laughing yet?
rotten	A movie which light-heartedly treads around ideas of corruption, race relations and corporate greed, Get Hard somehow manages to fall flat at almost every corner.
rotten	My complaint isn't that the film is "racist"- it's that it doesn't use that sort of material to do anything particularly original or funny.
rotten	Anal rape jokes and racial stereotypes dominate this third-rate comedy.
rotten	Leaves a gap that should be filled with gags.
fresh	Get Hard is stupid, raunchy and offensive -- but that's what it's going for.
rotten	The whole film is a nonstop parade of dick jokes, rape jokes, and Will Ferrell making the same goofy faces he first introduced on SNL ages ago.
fresh	Get Hard manages to be funny enough to both recommend and to laugh at out loud without feeling public embarrassment.
rotten	Get Hard is hard to sit through and hardly funny.
rotten	The germ of an interesting idea in Get Hard is completely overshadowed by the onslaught of jokes meant to be boundary-pushing and edgy.
fresh	Subtly, not in a way anyone would notice without looking for it, the movie switches back and forth, giving each comedian a chance to be the funny one and the other to lend support.
fresh	Ideally, this would be Blazing Saddles for folks who chug kombucha. Yet it's harder to satirize race today than it was 40 years ago - more sensitive times impose gentler jokes.
rotten	The film's numbing lack of intelligence, exhibited from the start, makes "Get Hard" tough to watch, even by Hart/Ferrell standards.
rotten	In a parallel world, there is a version of this movie that is just as offensive, but also funny and smart. It's a pity we will never see it.
rotten	Tries hard to turn Ferrell/Hart into Wilder/Pryor but fails miserably.
rotten	by the final act, the entire fish-out-of-water concept is scrapped as Hart and Ferrell play bumbling cops and robbers and attempt to solve a crime. Haven't we been punished enough?
rotten	Descends so far into racial stereotyping, offhanded homophobia, class division, sexual coarseness and scatological gags that whatever chemistry the stars might have brought to the table is pretty much dissipated.
fresh	Hart and Ferrell may not be Pryor and Wilder, but they score several laughs in this slim comedy.
rotten	Get Hard is a movie that wants to be perverse so bad ... but the delicate line necessary has scribble marks all over it. Get Hard is sad scribble.
rotten	It's like a chocolate wrapped in poop and then dipped in more chocolate. There's no way to enjoy it without tasting some crap.
rotten	it requires an awful lot of dense conceptual thinking to see Get Hard as a genuine satire of race, and not an exercise in old-fashioned stereotype-based comedy.
rotten	This is a horrible idea for a movie. It is, however, a decent idea for an extended sketch, and that's how the first two-thirds of the movie plays.
rotten	The dubious merit of tiresome "don't drop the soap" jokes aside, "Get Hard" sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.
rotten	I laughed when Ferrell smashed a bottle of beer on the sidewalk, just to show he's tough, but if that's a movie's standout bit, that movie's no standout.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart join forces for a fitfully amusing but problematically conceived modern-day version of Trading Places.
rotten	I wish the on-point shots taken at the so-called investor class weren't just a prelude to a rather generic, weak-willed, and vulgar farce.
rotten	Get Hard is one limp noodle.
rotten	It's hard to believe the man who co-wrote "Tropic Thunder" and "Idiocracy" could be responsible for a movie this dreadful.
rotten	Getting huge laughs somewhere from Beavis and Butt-Head or their real-life equivalents.
rotten	"Get Hard" is not challenging its audience; it's pandering to it and trying to get away with weak material.
rotten	Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.
rotten	Get Hard tries for easy laughs over intelligent commentary, but it doesn't succeed at either one.
rotten	"Get Hard" wants to be a brash, unapologetic look at race and class but only wrings a few laughs from those topics, mostly spending its time floundering around in a dumb plot.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.

fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
fresh	[Blaire's] atrocious spelling and grammar will no doubt annoy purists, but speaks to how srsly stressed she is. And something as simple as a pointer hesitating or pacing between two windows provides its own window into her motivation.
fresh	As a harangue about cyberbullying, it's purely exploitative, but when "Unfriended" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives? It's srsly fun, imo.
rotten	A horror pic with a new gimmick that likely will spawn an entire subgenre of more substandard rubbish.
rotten	At times, "Unfriended" really clicks - but ultimately, it's a drag.
fresh	The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. It's supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest, but the movie is speaking the right language.
rotten	You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.
rotten	It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting, claustrophobic physical setting.
fresh	The best thing about "Unfriended," beyond its funny-nasty title, is that it doesn't play as remotely dull as it sounds even if most of the drama takes place inside shifting, overlapping windows.
fresh	Younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the film's underlying message ...
rotten	Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
rotten	Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no one's tried an idea before doesn't mean it's a great one.
fresh	A movie to be seen, if you can endure it-as a shrewd commercial venture, as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and, last and foremost, as a window on a mode of thinking that equates to a state of being.
rotten	The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable, yet unmotivated, character turns. There's no one to root for, not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough.
fresh	Fresh and fearsome fun.
rotten	I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood, or some sort of natural disaster. Aren't the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time?
rotten	One of the rare occasions where an aesthetic decision drives the experience... It lacks in the legitimate fear department, however.
fresh	Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015.
rotten	Unfriended should be applauded for addressing a very serious issue in today's culture of anonymity-driven public shaming, but the fact that it's surrounded by so much stupidity weakens its message.
fresh	It's a mean, potent little movie.
fresh	It looks just beneath the surface of today's technology and discovers a place crawling with terrors all its own.
fresh	The filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick, turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process, they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.
fresh	It's interesting to wonder how the film will age, given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem, technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.
fresh	Though not particularly ground-breaking-last year's Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick, and much more ambitiously-we're still going to "like" the result.
rotten	Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze, "Unfriended" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along.
fresh	It's basically Friday the 13th on a laptop, but the gimmick works like gangbusters. One request: Please Hollywood cybergods, no sequels.
fresh	It will be interesting after Unfriended ends its theatrical run and it can be viewed on a home computer. That will create the unsettling situation where the viewer is almost a new participant in this online game of supernatural cyberstalking.
fresh	It will surely cut close to the bone for many, as all the best horror movies do.
fresh	This isn't great cinema, folks. It's more of a novelty. But it's a cleverly constructed novelty.
fresh	"Unfriended" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But it's clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then ...
rotten	Unfriended proves that you absolutely can make a movie that unfolds entirely on a computer. The question it doesn't answer is why you'd want to.
fresh	Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 you'll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when, even if you're not a cyberbullying white teen.
fresh	We need these teens to click clearly diseased links and bicker with one another while a ghost eggs them on. It's ridiculous, but when executed this competently, the absurd becomes riveting.
fresh	A great gimmick, but uncinematic and not as scary as you'd hope.
fresh	Neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its "Titus Andronicus"-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises, it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can.
fresh	It hates millenials so much it could have been made by Ben Stiller's documentarian in 'While We're Young.'
fresh	...a modern take on Scream for the Skype generation.
fresh	While it's not a flawless fright flick, Unfriended gives us a good gimmick as byte-sized horror that's easy to 'like' before moving onto the next distraction.
fresh	Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre.
fresh	Simultaneously clever and exasperating.
fresh	This is a movie for savvy Internet kids, and it feels savvy itself. Unlike so many other movies that make this attempt and feel ancient, [Unfriended] feels current.
rotten	In the end one would rather be back at one's own computer, tending to the tedious details of digital life, than watching this clique get pinged to death.
fresh	A clever spin on the found footage genre, and a tight little horror flick that's good for a solid scare or two.
fresh	Writer Nelson Greaves and director Levan Gabriadze do a decent job of creating genuine tension within the almost theatrical, proscenium-like arrangement of the computer screen.
fresh	When the genre-film spectacle arrives, it's in full force, and the strictures of the framing device manage to amplify, rather than suppress, the impact of the shocks and scares.
rotten	"Unfriended" is diverting and energetic and should be awarded points for attempting to be the Facebook generation's "Ringu," but it fails to create memorable characters and is awash in tired cliches and muddy mythology.
fresh	None of the slasher stuff is anywhere near as disturbing as the routine cruelty of the actual internet.
fresh	It's a gimmick movie, and like most gimmick movies [it] sometimes bends over backwards to make it work. But like the best gimmick movies the conceit never gets boring, and it actually has something pointed to say.
fresh	Unfriended is a terrifying cyber nightmare for today's generation of laptop-loving teenagers who think trolls are the worst thing the internet has to offer.
fresh	Unfriended is a smart, thrilling, and addicting byte of horror that's worth thinking about. It'll be awhile before your mind hits CTRL + ALT + DEL on this one
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	Delivers a slick, serviceable blend of romance and melodrama. Your typical love and sacrifice and bull-riding tale.
rotten	There's little here to convince the audience of boy and girl's special chemistry, and nothing to attach the audience to them, either.
fresh	Everything is tied up in a neat moral bow, with Luke realising that the challenge of the rodeo pales next to the "longest ride" of the title, which -- I hope I'm not giving too much away -- is the ride they call life.
fresh	Though Tillman doesn't quite elevate the maudlin material into serious drama, the result is uncommonly sensitive.
rotten	Sparks' perverse need for love to be perfect-even if it takes cancer to make it happen-becomes The Longest Ride's undoing.
fresh	This is spoon-fed entertainment, but it tastes pretty good.
rotten	Even when Eastwood and Robertson, pleasant enough company, threaten to float off the screen, "The Longest Ride" glides along and delivers its reheated comfort food by the ton.
rotten	Everything in the movie is suffused by a vision of life that is resoundingly and evidently false, but as this vision is not repulsive, but is intended to reassure, the lies don't produce anger or frustration. No, they bring on the laughs.
rotten	The two-plus hours is mostly marked by an emptiness born of scene after scene designed to blatantly manipulate emotions rather than trigger them.
rotten	The Longest Ride is sentimental, forced and silly, but it's sure to hit the bull's-eye with its intended audience.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
rotten	Premise grabs, but more like excruciating eventually. I, Nobot.
rotten	It's the predictability that ultimately hurts "Ex Machina". Talk about killing the suspense ---
fresh	We can extract at least one truism from this imaginative and beguiling story. Women hate to be treated as chattel --- even if they're robots.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues.
fresh	A beautifully-crafted science fiction drama that recalls the ingenuity and brilliance of "Jurassic Park."
fresh	It may not be a modern masterpiece of sci-fi, but it's close enough to pass for one.
fresh	Visually stunning, intellectually provocative, emotionally powerful.
rotten	The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
fresh	"Ex Machina" isn't quite "Citizen Kane" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea.
fresh	Garland also seduces with clean frames, sleek, elegant surfaces, and the most physically convincing of robots on screen in memory. Sentience is sexy!
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
fresh	[Blaire's] atrocious spelling and grammar will no doubt annoy purists, but speaks to how srsly stressed she is. And something as simple as a pointer hesitating or pacing between two windows provides its own window into her motivation.
fresh	As a harangue about cyberbullying, it's purely exploitative, but when "Unfriended" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives? It's srsly fun, imo.
rotten	A horror pic with a new gimmick that likely will spawn an entire subgenre of more substandard rubbish.
rotten	At times, "Unfriended" really clicks - but ultimately, it's a drag.
fresh	The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. It's supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest, but the movie is speaking the right language.
rotten	You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.
rotten	It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting, claustrophobic physical setting.
fresh	The best thing about "Unfriended," beyond its funny-nasty title, is that it doesn't play as remotely dull as it sounds even if most of the drama takes place inside shifting, overlapping windows.
fresh	Younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the film's underlying message ...
rotten	Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
rotten	Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no one's tried an idea before doesn't mean it's a great one.
fresh	A movie to be seen, if you can endure it-as a shrewd commercial venture, as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and, last and foremost, as a window on a mode of thinking that equates to a state of being.
rotten	The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable, yet unmotivated, character turns. There's no one to root for, not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough.
fresh	Fresh and fearsome fun.
rotten	I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood, or some sort of natural disaster. Aren't the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time?
rotten	One of the rare occasions where an aesthetic decision drives the experience... It lacks in the legitimate fear department, however.
fresh	Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015.
rotten	Unfriended should be applauded for addressing a very serious issue in today's culture of anonymity-driven public shaming, but the fact that it's surrounded by so much stupidity weakens its message.
fresh	It's a mean, potent little movie.
fresh	It looks just beneath the surface of today's technology and discovers a place crawling with terrors all its own.
fresh	The filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick, turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process, they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.
fresh	It's interesting to wonder how the film will age, given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem, technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.
fresh	Though not particularly ground-breaking-last year's Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick, and much more ambitiously-we're still going to "like" the result.
rotten	Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze, "Unfriended" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along.
fresh	It's basically Friday the 13th on a laptop, but the gimmick works like gangbusters. One request: Please Hollywood cybergods, no sequels.
fresh	It will be interesting after Unfriended ends its theatrical run and it can be viewed on a home computer. That will create the unsettling situation where the viewer is almost a new participant in this online game of supernatural cyberstalking.
fresh	It will surely cut close to the bone for many, as all the best horror movies do.
fresh	This isn't great cinema, folks. It's more of a novelty. But it's a cleverly constructed novelty.
fresh	"Unfriended" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But it's clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then ...
rotten	Unfriended proves that you absolutely can make a movie that unfolds entirely on a computer. The question it doesn't answer is why you'd want to.
fresh	Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 you'll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when, even if you're not a cyberbullying white teen.
fresh	We need these teens to click clearly diseased links and bicker with one another while a ghost eggs them on. It's ridiculous, but when executed this competently, the absurd becomes riveting.
fresh	A great gimmick, but uncinematic and not as scary as you'd hope.
fresh	Neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its "Titus Andronicus"-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises, it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can.
fresh	It hates millenials so much it could have been made by Ben Stiller's documentarian in 'While We're Young.'
fresh	...a modern take on Scream for the Skype generation.
fresh	While it's not a flawless fright flick, Unfriended gives us a good gimmick as byte-sized horror that's easy to 'like' before moving onto the next distraction.
fresh	Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre.
fresh	Simultaneously clever and exasperating.
fresh	This is a movie for savvy Internet kids, and it feels savvy itself. Unlike so many other movies that make this attempt and feel ancient, [Unfriended] feels current.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
fresh	Huisman is charming, but it's Ford who makes this movie. Ford's been involved with so many action movies, it's easy to forget his acting talent.
fresh	Age Of Adaline rewards viewers who buy into its ludicrous premise with a frequently beautiful, occasionally stirring cinematic trinket.
rotten	The makings of an interesting movie are here, but the script, written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz, collapses on itself in the third act.
fresh	It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points. A rumination on loneliness.
fresh	Lovers of the genre will find plenty to love about the stylish Age of Adaline and may find themselves rooting through pockets for a tissue at points, a romance movie equivalent of a standing ovation.
rotten	The story itself is hardly epic and certainly isn't romantic, which makes us focus on how ludicrous the whole thing is.
rotten	Starved of sufficient comedy or drama, "The Age of Adaline" is a pipsqueak.
fresh	A surprisingly effective fable. Blake Lively is excellent.
rotten	A preposterous premise treated with great solemnity. Lively shines, though, as does Ford.
fresh	Plausibility, shmausibility. This is pretty schmaltz done right.
rotten	Someone should steal this concept and make a decent movie out of it.
rotten	"The Age of Adaline" works best as a simple story of boy meets girl; girl falls in love; girl mulls whether or not to reveal that she'll stay young forever. Everything else is just a lot of unnecessary noise.
rotten	As awkward love triangles go, this is second only to the 1989 film Chances Are, where Robert Downey Jr. discovers that in a past life, he was his girlfriend's father. (Gross.)
rotten	A middling romance intended as counter-programming before a summer of world-savers and life-takers, The Age of Adaline is an adequate way to kill a few mortal hours in the theater for romance fans.
fresh	"Adaline" Enchants Despite Lack of Chemistry
rotten	Manages to score some select moments of goodwill, but ultimately hampers itself with a severely underdeveloped story.
rotten	The story's magic realism is so torpid and affected as to make the film feel as if it, like Adaline herself, goes on forever.
fresh	Ultimately, you believe Lively as an old soul in a young body, carrying a heavy secret; you hope, somehow, that love will bring her a happy ending.
rotten	Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove, like someone just asked to kiss her hand. It might be the most sepia-toned performance I've ever seen.
fresh	This YA-style romantic fantasy could have been cringe-inducing; instead it's a serviceable fable about the importance of mortality.
rotten	For a movie that emulates literature, The Age Of Adaline never fits comfortably into a particular form-literary or cinematic.
rotten	Aims to be as timeless as its main character, but it ends up feeling like a musty relic.
rotten	If Estee Lauder made a movie, it might look a lot like The Age Of Adaline, a swooning, fawning romance about a woman who achieves what no anti-wrinkle cream has before.
fresh	A low-stakes, high-concept romance, gifted with warm cinematography and lush period trappings.
fresh	"The Age of Adaline" weaves a fantastical tale within a plausible real-world setting. Blake Lively gives a performance of remarkable depth and sensitivity.
fresh	Shameless but mostly well-executed date-night fare, but Blake Lively seems like the wrong fit for the lead.
rotten	Lively's performance is appropriately mysterious but too shallow to allow audiences to empathize with her character. The fault lies more in the screenplay, which doesn't give her character much depth.
fresh	Beautiful but shallow, but also beautiful - a spell that only breaks once you turn on your brain, which you shouldn't anyway.
fresh	Adaline is consistently gorgeous to look at-and a good reminder that love, even when it's complicated or painful or doesn't last, is a whole lot better than immortality.
fresh	Age of Adaline - while frequently preposterous - has just enough pixie dust that it ought to find a fan base among romantic types.
rotten	Less a sincerely kooky elegy to lost time than a slightly off-kilter acting out of familiar rom-com bona fides about commitment-phobes missing out on life.
fresh	Sad, wistfully romantic and featuring maybe the best performance Harrison Ford has ever given on the big screen.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a pearl of a film: intimate despite its century long scale, new and old at once, it's a small movie to discover and carry with you.
fresh	Lively is an odd screen presence - somehow both warm and cold, accessible and recessive. She's long been ripe for a breakthrough lead role that allows her to stretch and surprise.
rotten	Lively's never been better, but "Adaline" is more interested in what she's wearing than what her character's thinking.
fresh	Blake Lively's subtle, expressive performance sets the tone for this thoroughly ludicrous, thoroughly enjoyable romantic drama.
rotten	Director Lee Toland Krieger hits all the expected emotional beats but doesn't take many risks or glean sufficient insights about our fascination with the double-edged sword of eternal youth.
fresh	In what is likely to be the year's most deliriously satisfying illustration of what happens when you feed a chick flick steroids, Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) hits emotional paydirt as a turn-of-the-20th-century gal who stops ageing at 29.
fresh	Stay far away if romantic movies bother you. For everyone else, this very much delivers on its earnest intentions.
rotten	It floats, like Lively herself, in a kind of timeless bubble.
fresh	Indie darling Lee Toland Krieger has managed to pull off this high concept film with an innocent charm that harks back to Golden Age Hollywood romance.
fresh	Harrison Ford emerges as Krieger's trump card...It is a raw, vulnerable performance that ensures the film soars and draws fresh reserves out of Lively (the definition of 'Supporting Actor', surely).
fresh	Never mind that the story is far fetched, the film engages largely due to a winning central performance by Blake Lively as the ageless Adaline, who spends her life running instead of living because she fears someone will learn her secret
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
fresh	Huisman is charming, but it's Ford who makes this movie. Ford's been involved with so many action movies, it's easy to forget his acting talent.
fresh	Age Of Adaline rewards viewers who buy into its ludicrous premise with a frequently beautiful, occasionally stirring cinematic trinket.
rotten	The makings of an interesting movie are here, but the script, written by J. Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz, collapses on itself in the third act.
fresh	It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points. A rumination on loneliness.
fresh	Lovers of the genre will find plenty to love about the stylish Age of Adaline and may find themselves rooting through pockets for a tissue at points, a romance movie equivalent of a standing ovation.
rotten	The story itself is hardly epic and certainly isn't romantic, which makes us focus on how ludicrous the whole thing is.
rotten	Starved of sufficient comedy or drama, "The Age of Adaline" is a pipsqueak.
fresh	A surprisingly effective fable. Blake Lively is excellent.
rotten	A preposterous premise treated with great solemnity. Lively shines, though, as does Ford.
fresh	Plausibility, shmausibility. This is pretty schmaltz done right.
rotten	Someone should steal this concept and make a decent movie out of it.
rotten	"The Age of Adaline" works best as a simple story of boy meets girl; girl falls in love; girl mulls whether or not to reveal that she'll stay young forever. Everything else is just a lot of unnecessary noise.
rotten	As awkward love triangles go, this is second only to the 1989 film Chances Are, where Robert Downey Jr. discovers that in a past life, he was his girlfriend's father. (Gross.)
rotten	A middling romance intended as counter-programming before a summer of world-savers and life-takers, The Age of Adaline is an adequate way to kill a few mortal hours in the theater for romance fans.
fresh	"Adaline" Enchants Despite Lack of Chemistry
rotten	Manages to score some select moments of goodwill, but ultimately hampers itself with a severely underdeveloped story.
rotten	The story's magic realism is so torpid and affected as to make the film feel as if it, like Adaline herself, goes on forever.
fresh	Ultimately, you believe Lively as an old soul in a young body, carrying a heavy secret; you hope, somehow, that love will bring her a happy ending.
rotten	Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove, like someone just asked to kiss her hand. It might be the most sepia-toned performance I've ever seen.
fresh	This YA-style romantic fantasy could have been cringe-inducing; instead it's a serviceable fable about the importance of mortality.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
fresh	[Blaire's] atrocious spelling and grammar will no doubt annoy purists, but speaks to how srsly stressed she is. And something as simple as a pointer hesitating or pacing between two windows provides its own window into her motivation.
fresh	As a harangue about cyberbullying, it's purely exploitative, but when "Unfriended" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives? It's srsly fun, imo.
rotten	A horror pic with a new gimmick that likely will spawn an entire subgenre of more substandard rubbish.
rotten	At times, "Unfriended" really clicks - but ultimately, it's a drag.
fresh	The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. It's supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest, but the movie is speaking the right language.
rotten	You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.
rotten	It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting, claustrophobic physical setting.
fresh	The best thing about "Unfriended," beyond its funny-nasty title, is that it doesn't play as remotely dull as it sounds even if most of the drama takes place inside shifting, overlapping windows.
fresh	Younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the film's underlying message ...
rotten	Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
rotten	Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no one's tried an idea before doesn't mean it's a great one.
fresh	A movie to be seen, if you can endure it-as a shrewd commercial venture, as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and, last and foremost, as a window on a mode of thinking that equates to a state of being.
rotten	The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable, yet unmotivated, character turns. There's no one to root for, not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough.
fresh	Fresh and fearsome fun.
rotten	I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood, or some sort of natural disaster. Aren't the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time?
rotten	One of the rare occasions where an aesthetic decision drives the experience... It lacks in the legitimate fear department, however.
fresh	Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015.
rotten	Unfriended should be applauded for addressing a very serious issue in today's culture of anonymity-driven public shaming, but the fact that it's surrounded by so much stupidity weakens its message.
fresh	It's a mean, potent little movie.
fresh	It looks just beneath the surface of today's technology and discovers a place crawling with terrors all its own.
fresh	The filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick, turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process, they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.
fresh	It's interesting to wonder how the film will age, given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem, technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.
fresh	Though not particularly ground-breaking-last year's Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick, and much more ambitiously-we're still going to "like" the result.
rotten	Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze, "Unfriended" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along.
fresh	It's basically Friday the 13th on a laptop, but the gimmick works like gangbusters. One request: Please Hollywood cybergods, no sequels.
fresh	It will be interesting after Unfriended ends its theatrical run and it can be viewed on a home computer. That will create the unsettling situation where the viewer is almost a new participant in this online game of supernatural cyberstalking.
fresh	It will surely cut close to the bone for many, as all the best horror movies do.
fresh	This isn't great cinema, folks. It's more of a novelty. But it's a cleverly constructed novelty.
fresh	"Unfriended" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But it's clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then ...
rotten	Unfriended proves that you absolutely can make a movie that unfolds entirely on a computer. The question it doesn't answer is why you'd want to.
fresh	Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 you'll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when, even if you're not a cyberbullying white teen.
fresh	We need these teens to click clearly diseased links and bicker with one another while a ghost eggs them on. It's ridiculous, but when executed this competently, the absurd becomes riveting.
fresh	A great gimmick, but uncinematic and not as scary as you'd hope.
fresh	Neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its "Titus Andronicus"-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises, it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can.
fresh	It hates millenials so much it could have been made by Ben Stiller's documentarian in 'While We're Young.'
fresh	...a modern take on Scream for the Skype generation.
fresh	While it's not a flawless fright flick, Unfriended gives us a good gimmick as byte-sized horror that's easy to 'like' before moving onto the next distraction.
fresh	Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre.
fresh	Simultaneously clever and exasperating.
fresh	This is a movie for savvy Internet kids, and it feels savvy itself. Unlike so many other movies that make this attempt and feel ancient, [Unfriended] feels current.
rotten	In the end one would rather be back at one's own computer, tending to the tedious details of digital life, than watching this clique get pinged to death.
fresh	A clever spin on the found footage genre, and a tight little horror flick that's good for a solid scare or two.
fresh	Writer Nelson Greaves and director Levan Gabriadze do a decent job of creating genuine tension within the almost theatrical, proscenium-like arrangement of the computer screen.
fresh	When the genre-film spectacle arrives, it's in full force, and the strictures of the framing device manage to amplify, rather than suppress, the impact of the shocks and scares.
rotten	"Unfriended" is diverting and energetic and should be awarded points for attempting to be the Facebook generation's "Ringu," but it fails to create memorable characters and is awash in tired cliches and muddy mythology.
fresh	None of the slasher stuff is anywhere near as disturbing as the routine cruelty of the actual internet.
fresh	It's a gimmick movie, and like most gimmick movies [it] sometimes bends over backwards to make it work. But like the best gimmick movies the conceit never gets boring, and it actually has something pointed to say.
fresh	Unfriended is a terrifying cyber nightmare for today's generation of laptop-loving teenagers who think trolls are the worst thing the internet has to offer.
fresh	Unfriended is a smart, thrilling, and addicting byte of horror that's worth thinking about. It'll be awhile before your mind hits CTRL + ALT + DEL on this one
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
rotten	Premise grabs, but more like excruciating eventually. I, Nobot.
rotten	It's the predictability that ultimately hurts "Ex Machina". Talk about killing the suspense ---
fresh	We can extract at least one truism from this imaginative and beguiling story. Women hate to be treated as chattel --- even if they're robots.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues.
fresh	A beautifully-crafted science fiction drama that recalls the ingenuity and brilliance of "Jurassic Park."
fresh	It may not be a modern masterpiece of sci-fi, but it's close enough to pass for one.
fresh	Visually stunning, intellectually provocative, emotionally powerful.
rotten	The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
fresh	"Ex Machina" isn't quite "Citizen Kane" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea.
fresh	Garland also seduces with clean frames, sleek, elegant surfaces, and the most physically convincing of robots on screen in memory. Sentience is sexy!
fresh	A singularly chilling cinematic stunner that coexists as a wild daydream and a prescient glimpse into the future.
fresh	A rattling and ruminative piece of speculative fiction, Ex Machina is good enough to wish it were even better.
fresh	Its aura of cool menace is largely attributable to Isaac, stealing his every scene as the smoothly bullying CEO, and production designer Mark Digby, who created the millionaire's sleek, high-tech mountain fortress.
fresh	Ex Machina addresses heady issues of A.I., exploring what it means to be human or, more important, what it means to be an imitation of humanity so real, what's the actual difference?
fresh	A coolly cerebral sci-fi tale that really isn't all that inventive but nonetheless casts quie a spell.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a smart, exceptionally stylish head trip.
fresh	Garland sidles up to some large ideas, some more provocative than others, and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual, omnivorous surveillance.
fresh	It's hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes.
fresh	Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina, a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence, consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story, dialogue and character.
fresh	Merciless, efficient and terrifyingly logical...
fresh	Ex Machina is intelligent science fiction operating at a very high level.
fresh	It will make you look at every other movie about artificial intelligence in a whole new way.
rotten	More tricky than smart.
fresh	In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate.
fresh	Garland more than establishes himself as talent to watch. The perfect balance between the cerebral and the emotional, crafting a thrilling film that still remains intellectually provocative - A difficult creature to build indeed.
fresh	The best thing about "Ex Machina" is the robotic depiction of Ava, a sleek humanoid that exudes sex appeal.
fresh	Slow paced, but thought provoking science fiction.
fresh	A thrilling work of sci-fi ... a smart and visually alluring film that contemplates chilling questions about where technology is headed and the consequences of playing God.
fresh	Beautifully haunting.
fresh	With Ex Machina writer/director Alex Garfield delivers a science fiction film full of concepts and ideas versus overblown visual effects.
fresh	Like Ava herself, Garland manipulates our sympathies, rendering his climax all the more horrifying and his denouement, albeit understated, terrifying.
fresh	This is the best, most credible, of the artificial intelligence movies to date. Garland keeps the tension up and the pace moving by tackling many thought-provoking existential issues. I was pleasantly surprised, rewarded, by what I had just seen.
rotten	The writer and director, Alex Garland, keeps the movie so full of doomy atmosphere that expecting the worst sort of becomes a treat. But gradually the hypnosis wears off, the mystique dissipates, and banalities take over.
fresh	Many movies...almost require a reverse Turing test - you can't quite believe they were written by humans, rather than number-crunching machines. I'm happy to say Ex Machina would pass.
fresh	A chilly yet engrossing drama, elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garland's screenplay.
fresh	Ex Machina achieves that rare combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings, and it deserves to be known as a sci-fi classic.
fresh	A TED Talk in the form of a movie, with a few creepy twists and suspenseful deceptions that keep the plot moving forward.
fresh	[O]ne of the finest sci-fi productions of the decade... as intellectually compelling as it is emotionally provocative.
fresh	Gleeson is terrific and Vikander, who stars in five other films this year alone, is a revelation. As is Ex Machina, a movie that looks like something destined to be savored, watched and re-watched endlessly over the years.
fresh	We will be very lucky if we get another movie either as good or better this year.
fresh	...doesn't hold a candle to Spike Jonze's "Her" for insights into man's relationship with artificial intelligence. For all its stunning locations, brilliant design and seamless visual effects, the story begs the question 'Is that all there is?'
fresh	A small sci-fi classic...
fresh	Although "Ex Machina" is small and talky - it has just four characters, and the only action comes at the end - it also looks good. The set direction is interesting and evocative. The effects impress but don't overwhelm.
fresh	Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made, "Ex Machina" is a spooky piece of speculative fiction that's completely plausible, capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills.
fresh	While Mr. Garland wants to tease your brain, he's an entertainer, and in time ditches science and philosophy for romance and action.
fresh	turns a standard story into something quite special
rotten	Reasonably diverting until its predictable (and predictably misogynistic) outcome.
fresh	It's become far too commonplace to overuse the term 'masterpiece,' but Alex Garland's directorial debut comes about as close as you can get.
fresh	I know, I know. You've seen all this A.I. stuff before. But never like this. Garland is hot for ethical shop talk on what defines humanity or lack of same.
fresh	Sizzlingly smart and agreeably sententious, Mr. Garland's film transcends some all-too-human imperfections with gorgeous images, astute writing and memorably strong performances.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron has everything fans have been waiting for. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	The Avengers return in an epic adventure with a little romance and tragedy to keep the spectacle grounded.
fresh	Age of Ultron is not disappointing but it is definitely not better the first one. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	I began to forget the breathless, teetering, tottering, careening, catapulting Avengers: The Age Of Ultron about 20 minutes into its 141 minutes... Zoom, quip, wham, smirk, quip, blam! Quip! Oh so much too-muchness on an inhumane scale.
rotten	It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?
rotten	The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore.
rotten	[The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters.
fresh	As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if they're putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine.
rotten	When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?
fresh	Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward.
fresh	Though advertised as a darker and more brooding follow-up, the real surprise of Ultron is how much in line with the first film's tone and structural beats this is.
fresh	It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human.
fresh	A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
fresh	The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that it's reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties.
fresh	It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it.
fresh	There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw.
rotten	Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
fresh	Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now.
fresh	Whedon is still Whedon, and the grace notes -- the snappy patter, the team dynamics, the "man, that was cool" moments -- go a long way.
fresh	Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.
fresh	The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball.
rotten	That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that "Ultron" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder.
fresh	The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movie's very elegant fluidity rests ...
fresh	At this point the Marvel superhero movies are as machine-tooled as a Prius, and this one sticks closely to the blueprint that's made them box office titans.
fresh	You can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first "Avengers," has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life.
fresh	With Marvel's universe expanding and intertwining at an ever increasing rate, "Age of Ultron" feels less like a sequel than a cosmic event.
fresh	Regardless, this time with Avengers: Age of Ultron, our socks were only tugged on, halfway flopping off our collective toes, but never blown quite off.
rotten	More of the same, just not as good--lots of sound and fury (along with some Fury) signifying very little.
fresh	Whedon is as interested in how the team works under stress as he is in the way pavement cracks under the collective weight of the Hulk and Stark's Hulkbuster armor.
fresh	By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms, franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs: a dollop of charm.
fresh	As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own.
fresh	"Age of Ultron" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop.
fresh	Whedon's wit and invention are considerable...[but] the movies keep getting bigger, with diminishing returns. I find myself hoping against hope that Ant-Man will be really, really small.
fresh	As he did in the first "Avengers," writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun.
fresh	Spader is so charismatic, so purely, quietly and wittily nasty, that he provides a welcome contrast to the rote wisecracking of our heroes, who are so busy trying to one-up each others' punchlines that they are beginning to come off like "Avengers' 11."
fresh	Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment.
rotten	A whole bunch of blather leads up to the same old climax with imperiled innocents and massive destruction.
fresh	Age of Ultron is a feast of visual delights, but plot wears thin. If Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), who are now taking over the Avengers series, want to keep the audience fully invested, some re-Assembly is required.
fresh	More bloated, but bolder than its predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron is every bit the 11th entry in Marvel's winning, world-dominating formula.
fresh	It's one you're going to want to see because when it shines, it shines bright, but Avengers: Age of Ultron is just a little worrying that the universe is already buckling under its own weight.
fresh	Okay as a diversion but nowhere close to matching any number of other singular superhero movies. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	...the film starts out attempting to question the Avengers' place in the world and whether they really make a difference, only to forget to probe for an answer not long after the asking.
fresh	There seems to be a lot of pressure for Avengers: Age of Ultron to more than just a movie, which really hampers its ability to be a movie.
rotten	There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going.
rotten	Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him.
fresh	Director Joss Whedon follows up his billion-dollar superhero smash the way most sequel makers try to up their game: by amping up everything everybody liked the first time around, plus more! More! More!
fresh	...a comic book movie, to be sure, but it's got enough spectacle, wit, and talent on display to make it a most entertaining kickoff to the season.
rotten	Black Widow chooses the Hulk over Thor? Females everywhere say "Huh?" The Avengers show absolutely no interest in each other. AGE OF ULTRON is soulless.
fresh	Talk about feeding the beast. Josh Whedon's never dull chapter in the franchise is practically bursting at its seams, relentlessly serving up just what the fans of this brand are expecting.
fresh	Age of Ultron can be a little unwieldy, but when it works, it works really well.
fresh	An entertaining package of characters and ideas that manages to be a whole lot more than the first film while also being a little bit less.
fresh	The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
fresh	It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom.
rotten	Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length.
fresh	A middling film, yet it's so heavy with Joss Whedon's sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in --- which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment.
fresh	Sometimes the super-heroism is just brightly colored junk food. And sometimes, it's a way of giving us a glimpse of how we flawed, messed-up, occasionally monstrous humans can sometimes prove ourselves worthy.
fresh	It feels as if this comic book franchise has become a never-ending cinema story. If future films are as well realized as Ultron, that's fine by me.
fresh	It would be silly to pretend that Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't good at what it does, that it's not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron may be very similar to the original film, but that's ok, for it still results in an equally thrilling ride.
fresh	The climactic act of "Age of Ultron" is full of colossal ka-booms and special effects, but it also has heft and reason and a bass-note of emotion.
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
rotten	Lazy gags, and it's been done better elsewhere.
fresh	This kiddie sci-fi adaptation doesn't quite live up to its evocative title.
fresh	I brought a couple of my kids, who liked it fine and found the friendship at the center rather affecting.
rotten	The feature doesn't connect in a significant way, reduced to a series of skits, poo-poo, pee-pee jokes, and commercials for the soundtrack.
fresh	Oh and Tip may not be the most memorable animated duo, but Parsons's high-pitched squeal and the groove in Rihanna's voice bounce off each other nicely.
rotten	While watching "Home," a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
fresh	You could do a lot better in the kid-film arena than this, but you could also do a Smek of a lot worse.
rotten	DreamWorks movies are often about outsiders learning that they don't have to fit in, a lesson the filmmakers may not have absorbed themselves.
rotten	Only mildly annoying.
rotten	The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.
rotten	Like the timorous Boov, "Home" has little interest in risk-taking.
rotten	Home cunningly attempts to achieve that always-expected animated feat of being everything to everyone, but what it really proves -- with more authenticity than the content itself can muster -- is just how infrequently that can be done.
rotten	Racial diversity and girl power are dandy, but they cannot compensate for uninspired material.
fresh	Aimed squarely at eight-and-unders.
fresh	As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm.
fresh	Home doesn't sparkle enough to make the transition from kids film to modern classic... That said, Home is possibly the most cheerful alien-invasion-of-Earth film you're likely to see.
rotten	An earnest exercise that falls flat, despite the best of intentions.
fresh	"Home" is a solid double in a time when DreamWorks really needs a home run.
rotten	Home marks a throwback to the hyperactive, pop culture-fixated DreamWorks of old, where star power alone pushes straight-to-VOD material into theatres
rotten	Home's exposition is a mess of forced zaniness, which leaves the rest of the film with a Swiss-cheese foundation.
rotten	Steve Martin has fun as the pompous Captain Smek, but this remains little more than colourfully inoffensive.
fresh	Home has an original, convincingly satirical concept at its heart, but much of the execution feels overly familiar.
rotten	It's good, clean, harmless fun.
fresh	A pastel-coloured visual delight with an emphasis on soft-edges and bubbles, director Tim Johnson (Antz; Over the Hedge) aims the film squarely at kids who won't mind the regular overdoses of touchy-feely cheese.
rotten	...more than likely going into the DreamWorks pile of films you won't remember in five years time.
fresh	ET meets Lilo & Stitch in this sweet, screwball culture clash comedy adapted from Adam Rex's children's novel The True Meaning of Smekday.
rotten	This bowls along amiably enough, boosted by some astonishing visuals, but is let down by a gossamer-thin script and uninspired characters.
rotten	Home is schematic and moralistic in the frequent manner of modern American cartoons, although the moralising doesn't entirely make sense: there are a couple of underlying metaphors that don't quite mesh.
fresh	The film combines wit with mind-boggling inanity but is so brash and good-natured that it is very hard to dislike.
rotten	The film takes the lazy route of cannibalising pop cultural references rather than coming up with decent jokes.
fresh	An entertaining odd-couple comedy on very traditional lines ...
rotten	Animation has become a crowded field, and perhaps we shouldn't always expect something out of this world, but this underdeveloped offering barely lifts itself off the drawing board. It's very, very...oh.
rotten	Mostly harmless.
rotten	Home does very little to be interesting or original.
fresh	A sharp script and especially colourful imagery make this animated romp a lot more fun than expected, entertaining grown-ups just as much as the kids...
fresh	Science fiction with training wheels, fine for sucking the kiddies into geekery but with little appeal for grownup fans of animated genre adventure.
rotten	Inoffensive but flavourless, and crammed with familiar elements from better movies like  Lilo and Stitch ,  Toy Story  and  Despicable Me .
rotten	Home's infantilism is a regressive step for DreamWorks, offering a sour rather than sweet experience for audiences.
fresh	Adapted from Adam Rex's novel in praise of family and friends, Antz director Tim Johnson's film is original and fresh, with an easy to understand narrative that finds its endearing protagonist Oh on a journey that takes him from zero to hero
rotten	There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like Home, an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar.
fresh	The story has a pleasant warmth to it - together with a vague message about individuality and tolerance - and Parsons does a terrific job bringing the charmingly open-hearted Oh to life.
rotten	From a creative standpoint, this is the studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Dragon."
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
rotten	Not entirely unfunny.
fresh	Your standard Ferrell/Hart vehicle that's rarely witty enough to live up to its potential, but still delivers enough laughs for those seeking a silly comedy.
rotten	The highest praise I can give "Get Hard" is that it is not quite as awful as it could have been.
rotten	A lazy attempt to drag out a Funny or Die-style skit to feature length by continuously recycling about eight minutes worth of gags.
rotten	Expect over-the-top idiocy. Expect graphic sexual gags. Expect a lesson on the prison art of 'keistering.' And, yes, expect lots of dicey racial humor.
rotten	Will Ferrell has built his film career on being an everyman or a naif devoid of self-consciousness. In Etan Cohen's Get Hard, Ferrell goes with the latter, but adds a patina of ultra-rich entitlement.
fresh	The movie seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts.
fresh	Silly, offensive but effective.
rotten	Weighed down by endless jokes about prison rape, relentless homophobia and a bevy of absurd stereotypes, this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart film sinks into an abyss of failure.
rotten	The distasteful, often flat Get Hard succeeds only as a testament to the resilience of talent.
rotten	With Ferrell and Hart involved, it's probably impossible for anyone to completely resist their baser instincts to be amused by the patently offensive. Though it's hard not to wish more moviegoers would.
fresh	It's still ultimately a disposable work, but at least while it's going, it hits hard.
fresh	It's tricky territory to tread, and Get Hard doesn't always get it right, but in a nation where racial and economic divides are growing issues, it deserves credit for trying.
fresh	The high concept is delivered more or less efficiently: basically an incorrect and funnier version of Spike Lee's 25th Hour, with a dash of Trading Places.
rotten	The oft-repeated gags about prison rape and the frequent racial stereotypes become such a drag that solitary confinement might be a welcome break.
rotten	A movie that refuses to recognize when it's going too far, with its wince-eliciting jokes about jailhouse rape in particular.
rotten	A movie you're waiting to finish rather than anticipating the finale.
rotten	If you don't think the over-rehearsed prospect of prison rape - specifically, black-on-white prison rape - is quite enough of a comedy goldmine to sustain a whole feature, tell that to the screenwriters.
fresh	Will Ferrell is looking at ten years in the slammer in a comedy that delivers a hard slap in the face to political correctness.
fresh	If Get Hard isn't quite the biting satire that its premise would imply - though it's more unabashedly eat-the-rich than some critics have given it credit for - it's consistently ridiculous enough to be funny more often than not.
fresh	Pairing Ferrell's looming, kooky calm with Hart's pint-sized, pugnacious bluster proves a complimentary meshing, rising star Hart's incredulous observer an audience stand-in for Ferrell's boor-out-of-water style comedy.
rotten	The movie overcompensates for its lack of cleverness with an oversimplified story and an enormous amount of lowbrow humor.
rotten	Funny bits come along every now and then, and the co-stars work desperately hard for their salaries. But the spectacle is depressing for what it says of mainstream studio standards.
rotten	Here is an ounce of credit to Get Hard for avoiding any mention of the innuendo involving an inmate dropping the soap in the prison shower.
rotten	Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence.
rotten	Get Hard is just smart enough and funny enough to make you realize that with a little actual effort it might have been much more funny. But why bother writing jokes or a plot when it's easier to talk about how much anal rape goes on in prison?
rotten	'Get Hard' might be the perfect flick to show at your next frat party at the University of Oklahoma.
rotten	All the comedic and visual elan of an amateur YouTube fratboy prank, include nonstop rape jokes and rampant homophobia. Are you laughing yet?
rotten	A movie which light-heartedly treads around ideas of corruption, race relations and corporate greed, Get Hard somehow manages to fall flat at almost every corner.
rotten	My complaint isn't that the film is "racist"- it's that it doesn't use that sort of material to do anything particularly original or funny.
rotten	Anal rape jokes and racial stereotypes dominate this third-rate comedy.
rotten	Leaves a gap that should be filled with gags.
fresh	Get Hard is stupid, raunchy and offensive -- but that's what it's going for.
rotten	The whole film is a nonstop parade of dick jokes, rape jokes, and Will Ferrell making the same goofy faces he first introduced on SNL ages ago.
fresh	Get Hard manages to be funny enough to both recommend and to laugh at out loud without feeling public embarrassment.
rotten	Get Hard is hard to sit through and hardly funny.
rotten	The germ of an interesting idea in Get Hard is completely overshadowed by the onslaught of jokes meant to be boundary-pushing and edgy.
fresh	Subtly, not in a way anyone would notice without looking for it, the movie switches back and forth, giving each comedian a chance to be the funny one and the other to lend support.
fresh	Ideally, this would be Blazing Saddles for folks who chug kombucha. Yet it's harder to satirize race today than it was 40 years ago - more sensitive times impose gentler jokes.
rotten	The film's numbing lack of intelligence, exhibited from the start, makes "Get Hard" tough to watch, even by Hart/Ferrell standards.
rotten	In a parallel world, there is a version of this movie that is just as offensive, but also funny and smart. It's a pity we will never see it.
rotten	Tries hard to turn Ferrell/Hart into Wilder/Pryor but fails miserably.
rotten	by the final act, the entire fish-out-of-water concept is scrapped as Hart and Ferrell play bumbling cops and robbers and attempt to solve a crime. Haven't we been punished enough?
rotten	Descends so far into racial stereotyping, offhanded homophobia, class division, sexual coarseness and scatological gags that whatever chemistry the stars might have brought to the table is pretty much dissipated.
fresh	Hart and Ferrell may not be Pryor and Wilder, but they score several laughs in this slim comedy.
rotten	Get Hard is a movie that wants to be perverse so bad ... but the delicate line necessary has scribble marks all over it. Get Hard is sad scribble.
rotten	It's like a chocolate wrapped in poop and then dipped in more chocolate. There's no way to enjoy it without tasting some crap.
rotten	it requires an awful lot of dense conceptual thinking to see Get Hard as a genuine satire of race, and not an exercise in old-fashioned stereotype-based comedy.
rotten	This is a horrible idea for a movie. It is, however, a decent idea for an extended sketch, and that's how the first two-thirds of the movie plays.
rotten	The dubious merit of tiresome "don't drop the soap" jokes aside, "Get Hard" sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.
rotten	I laughed when Ferrell smashed a bottle of beer on the sidewalk, just to show he's tough, but if that's a movie's standout bit, that movie's no standout.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart join forces for a fitfully amusing but problematically conceived modern-day version of Trading Places.
rotten	I wish the on-point shots taken at the so-called investor class weren't just a prelude to a rather generic, weak-willed, and vulgar farce.
rotten	Get Hard is one limp noodle.
rotten	It's hard to believe the man who co-wrote "Tropic Thunder" and "Idiocracy" could be responsible for a movie this dreadful.
rotten	Getting huge laughs somewhere from Beavis and Butt-Head or their real-life equivalents.
rotten	"Get Hard" is not challenging its audience; it's pandering to it and trying to get away with weak material.
rotten	Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.
rotten	Get Hard tries for easy laughs over intelligent commentary, but it doesn't succeed at either one.
rotten	"Get Hard" wants to be a brash, unapologetic look at race and class but only wrings a few laughs from those topics, mostly spending its time floundering around in a dumb plot.
rotten	Somewhere amid the unbearable stereotypes that choke this sophomoric comedy is a potent blue-collar revenge fantasy about an arrogant white-collar crook getting his just comeuppance.
fresh	Only the humorless will frown at Ferrell's easy way with white-guy entitlement. "I'm going to be attending San Quentin," the Harvard grad sniffs, almost as a point of pride; later, after tasting thug life, he calls it an "ambrosia of primal sensations."
rotten	Get Hard is not only a bad movie but a profoundly wasted opportunity.
rotten	It's still a dumb movie, but the kind of dumb movie that, by bravely (or stupidly) strutting its way into prickly social discussions accidentally makes cogent points about same. Sometimes.
fresh	For some reason this movie offended a lot of critic-types at SXSW but the only thing that would really be offensive here is if it wasn't funny. And thanks to a nice teaming of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart this is surprisingly funny stuff.
fresh	Racist, and more than a little homophobic. But also frequently funny, until it gets really silly trying to follow a plot.
rotten	"Get Hard" isn't edgy enough to be offensive or witty enough to be challenging. It's just dumb.
fresh	In this occasionally brilliant, if somewhat uneven, showcase of speedy plotting and even speedier improvisation, Hart and Ferrell's chemistry is such that it seems certain to pair them up in the future.
fresh	Ferrell and Hart work well together: both are highly verbal performers, supported by a script full of unlikely linguistic flourishes.
rotten	For a movie whose premise depends on the mockery of someone who offensively stereotypes (Ferrell's character assumes that Hart's has been to prison), it deals heavily in stereotypes itself, wanting its cake and eating it too.
rotten	It already seems more dated than Trading Places - not to mention less savvy about all the subjects it pretends to be addressing while it tries to make us laugh.
fresh	Laughter trumps political fairness; and Get Hard made me laugh at, and with, situations I hadn't thought could tickle me. The movie has a warm heart beating under its seemingly scabrous shell.
rotten	If you're disturbed by white-collar crime, but not quite as disturbed as you are by gay sex, then congratulations: You might possess just the right combo of social conscience and unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy Get Hard.
fresh	There's a daring comedy somewhere inside writer Etan Cohen's directorial debut, which simultaneously trivializes and solemnizes the prospect of prison rape.
fresh	"Get Hard" is worth a look for fans of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. And the two do work well together. But anyone with a low tolerance for politically incorrect stereotyping and lowbrow humor should sit this one out.
rotten	Get Hard isn't terrible. It's funny often enough to stave off impatience. That's something, I guess.
rotten	Kevin Hart shoehorned into a standard issue Will Ferrell character comedy
fresh	Offensive by design and low-brow by nature, the joke wears thin by the end, but the film's saving grace is its raw energy; a feeling that anything goes, as the narrative leapfrogs from one unlikely bad-taste scenario to the next
fresh	An inspired pairing of the relentlessly absurd Ferrell and the motor-mouthed Hart at the top of their games.
fresh	It's stupid and immature, but I mean that as a compliment. Stupid and immature is funny.
rotten	The greatest comedic geniuses of our time or any other couldn't improve on a script as basically, fundamentally wrong as GET HARD's.
rotten	"Get Hard" is an absolutely horrible, amateurishly assembled comedy that is more offensive than just about anything we've seen lately.
rotten	Finally, a comedy that homophobes, racists and generally stupid people can all enjoy together!
rotten	Unfortunately, Hart and Ferrell just couldn't get hard enough for me.
rotten	Get Hard quickly descends from an off-putting comedy of opposites to the kind of movie that time and the changing styles of comedy in the modern age will turn into a relic sooner rather than later.
rotten	Hey, did you know that in prison, there is a lot of RAPE?
rotten	The script, by TV comedy writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts, doesn't give the stars much to work with and their apparent improvisation is only fleetingly effective.
fresh	Written down, this sounds horrendous; watching it, I have to admit that I laughed ...
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
rotten	Lazy gags, and it's been done better elsewhere.
fresh	This kiddie sci-fi adaptation doesn't quite live up to its evocative title.
fresh	I brought a couple of my kids, who liked it fine and found the friendship at the center rather affecting.
rotten	The feature doesn't connect in a significant way, reduced to a series of skits, poo-poo, pee-pee jokes, and commercials for the soundtrack.
fresh	Oh and Tip may not be the most memorable animated duo, but Parsons's high-pitched squeal and the groove in Rihanna's voice bounce off each other nicely.
rotten	While watching "Home," a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
fresh	You could do a lot better in the kid-film arena than this, but you could also do a Smek of a lot worse.
rotten	DreamWorks movies are often about outsiders learning that they don't have to fit in, a lesson the filmmakers may not have absorbed themselves.
rotten	Only mildly annoying.
rotten	The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.
rotten	Like the timorous Boov, "Home" has little interest in risk-taking.
rotten	Home cunningly attempts to achieve that always-expected animated feat of being everything to everyone, but what it really proves -- with more authenticity than the content itself can muster -- is just how infrequently that can be done.
rotten	Racial diversity and girl power are dandy, but they cannot compensate for uninspired material.
fresh	Aimed squarely at eight-and-unders.
fresh	As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm.
fresh	Home doesn't sparkle enough to make the transition from kids film to modern classic... That said, Home is possibly the most cheerful alien-invasion-of-Earth film you're likely to see.
rotten	An earnest exercise that falls flat, despite the best of intentions.
fresh	"Home" is a solid double in a time when DreamWorks really needs a home run.
rotten	Home marks a throwback to the hyperactive, pop culture-fixated DreamWorks of old, where star power alone pushes straight-to-VOD material into theatres
rotten	Home's exposition is a mess of forced zaniness, which leaves the rest of the film with a Swiss-cheese foundation.
rotten	Steve Martin has fun as the pompous Captain Smek, but this remains little more than colourfully inoffensive.
fresh	Home has an original, convincingly satirical concept at its heart, but much of the execution feels overly familiar.
rotten	It's good, clean, harmless fun.
fresh	A pastel-coloured visual delight with an emphasis on soft-edges and bubbles, director Tim Johnson (Antz; Over the Hedge) aims the film squarely at kids who won't mind the regular overdoses of touchy-feely cheese.
rotten	...more than likely going into the DreamWorks pile of films you won't remember in five years time.
fresh	ET meets Lilo & Stitch in this sweet, screwball culture clash comedy adapted from Adam Rex's children's novel The True Meaning of Smekday.
rotten	This bowls along amiably enough, boosted by some astonishing visuals, but is let down by a gossamer-thin script and uninspired characters.
rotten	Home is schematic and moralistic in the frequent manner of modern American cartoons, although the moralising doesn't entirely make sense: there are a couple of underlying metaphors that don't quite mesh.
fresh	The film combines wit with mind-boggling inanity but is so brash and good-natured that it is very hard to dislike.
rotten	The film takes the lazy route of cannibalising pop cultural references rather than coming up with decent jokes.
fresh	An entertaining odd-couple comedy on very traditional lines ...
rotten	Animation has become a crowded field, and perhaps we shouldn't always expect something out of this world, but this underdeveloped offering barely lifts itself off the drawing board. It's very, very...oh.
rotten	Mostly harmless.
rotten	Home does very little to be interesting or original.
fresh	A sharp script and especially colourful imagery make this animated romp a lot more fun than expected, entertaining grown-ups just as much as the kids...
fresh	Science fiction with training wheels, fine for sucking the kiddies into geekery but with little appeal for grownup fans of animated genre adventure.
rotten	Inoffensive but flavourless, and crammed with familiar elements from better movies like  Lilo and Stitch ,  Toy Story  and  Despicable Me .
rotten	Home's infantilism is a regressive step for DreamWorks, offering a sour rather than sweet experience for audiences.
fresh	Adapted from Adam Rex's novel in praise of family and friends, Antz director Tim Johnson's film is original and fresh, with an easy to understand narrative that finds its endearing protagonist Oh on a journey that takes him from zero to hero
rotten	There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like Home, an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar.
fresh	The story has a pleasant warmth to it - together with a vague message about individuality and tolerance - and Parsons does a terrific job bringing the charmingly open-hearted Oh to life.
rotten	From a creative standpoint, this is the studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Dragon."
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
rotten	Not entirely unfunny.
fresh	Your standard Ferrell/Hart vehicle that's rarely witty enough to live up to its potential, but still delivers enough laughs for those seeking a silly comedy.
rotten	The highest praise I can give "Get Hard" is that it is not quite as awful as it could have been.
rotten	A lazy attempt to drag out a Funny or Die-style skit to feature length by continuously recycling about eight minutes worth of gags.
rotten	Expect over-the-top idiocy. Expect graphic sexual gags. Expect a lesson on the prison art of 'keistering.' And, yes, expect lots of dicey racial humor.
rotten	Will Ferrell has built his film career on being an everyman or a naif devoid of self-consciousness. In Etan Cohen's Get Hard, Ferrell goes with the latter, but adds a patina of ultra-rich entitlement.
fresh	The movie seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts.
fresh	Silly, offensive but effective.
rotten	Weighed down by endless jokes about prison rape, relentless homophobia and a bevy of absurd stereotypes, this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart film sinks into an abyss of failure.
rotten	The distasteful, often flat Get Hard succeeds only as a testament to the resilience of talent.
rotten	With Ferrell and Hart involved, it's probably impossible for anyone to completely resist their baser instincts to be amused by the patently offensive. Though it's hard not to wish more moviegoers would.
fresh	It's still ultimately a disposable work, but at least while it's going, it hits hard.
fresh	It's tricky territory to tread, and Get Hard doesn't always get it right, but in a nation where racial and economic divides are growing issues, it deserves credit for trying.
fresh	The high concept is delivered more or less efficiently: basically an incorrect and funnier version of Spike Lee's 25th Hour, with a dash of Trading Places.
rotten	The oft-repeated gags about prison rape and the frequent racial stereotypes become such a drag that solitary confinement might be a welcome break.
rotten	A movie that refuses to recognize when it's going too far, with its wince-eliciting jokes about jailhouse rape in particular.
rotten	A movie you're waiting to finish rather than anticipating the finale.
rotten	If you don't think the over-rehearsed prospect of prison rape - specifically, black-on-white prison rape - is quite enough of a comedy goldmine to sustain a whole feature, tell that to the screenwriters.
fresh	Will Ferrell is looking at ten years in the slammer in a comedy that delivers a hard slap in the face to political correctness.
fresh	If Get Hard isn't quite the biting satire that its premise would imply - though it's more unabashedly eat-the-rich than some critics have given it credit for - it's consistently ridiculous enough to be funny more often than not.
fresh	Pairing Ferrell's looming, kooky calm with Hart's pint-sized, pugnacious bluster proves a complimentary meshing, rising star Hart's incredulous observer an audience stand-in for Ferrell's boor-out-of-water style comedy.
rotten	The movie overcompensates for its lack of cleverness with an oversimplified story and an enormous amount of lowbrow humor.
rotten	Funny bits come along every now and then, and the co-stars work desperately hard for their salaries. But the spectacle is depressing for what it says of mainstream studio standards.
rotten	Here is an ounce of credit to Get Hard for avoiding any mention of the innuendo involving an inmate dropping the soap in the prison shower.
rotten	Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence.
rotten	Get Hard is just smart enough and funny enough to make you realize that with a little actual effort it might have been much more funny. But why bother writing jokes or a plot when it's easier to talk about how much anal rape goes on in prison?
rotten	'Get Hard' might be the perfect flick to show at your next frat party at the University of Oklahoma.
rotten	All the comedic and visual elan of an amateur YouTube fratboy prank, include nonstop rape jokes and rampant homophobia. Are you laughing yet?
rotten	A movie which light-heartedly treads around ideas of corruption, race relations and corporate greed, Get Hard somehow manages to fall flat at almost every corner.
rotten	My complaint isn't that the film is "racist"- it's that it doesn't use that sort of material to do anything particularly original or funny.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
rotten	Premise grabs, but more like excruciating eventually. I, Nobot.
rotten	It's the predictability that ultimately hurts "Ex Machina". Talk about killing the suspense ---
fresh	We can extract at least one truism from this imaginative and beguiling story. Women hate to be treated as chattel --- even if they're robots.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues.
fresh	A beautifully-crafted science fiction drama that recalls the ingenuity and brilliance of "Jurassic Park."
fresh	It may not be a modern masterpiece of sci-fi, but it's close enough to pass for one.
fresh	Visually stunning, intellectually provocative, emotionally powerful.
rotten	The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
fresh	"Ex Machina" isn't quite "Citizen Kane" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea.
fresh	Garland also seduces with clean frames, sleek, elegant surfaces, and the most physically convincing of robots on screen in memory. Sentience is sexy!
fresh	A singularly chilling cinematic stunner that coexists as a wild daydream and a prescient glimpse into the future.
fresh	A rattling and ruminative piece of speculative fiction, Ex Machina is good enough to wish it were even better.
fresh	Its aura of cool menace is largely attributable to Isaac, stealing his every scene as the smoothly bullying CEO, and production designer Mark Digby, who created the millionaire's sleek, high-tech mountain fortress.
fresh	Ex Machina addresses heady issues of A.I., exploring what it means to be human or, more important, what it means to be an imitation of humanity so real, what's the actual difference?
fresh	A coolly cerebral sci-fi tale that really isn't all that inventive but nonetheless casts quie a spell.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a smart, exceptionally stylish head trip.
fresh	Garland sidles up to some large ideas, some more provocative than others, and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual, omnivorous surveillance.
fresh	It's hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes.
fresh	Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina, a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence, consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story, dialogue and character.
fresh	Merciless, efficient and terrifyingly logical...
fresh	Ex Machina is intelligent science fiction operating at a very high level.
fresh	It will make you look at every other movie about artificial intelligence in a whole new way.
rotten	More tricky than smart.
fresh	In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate.
fresh	Garland more than establishes himself as talent to watch. The perfect balance between the cerebral and the emotional, crafting a thrilling film that still remains intellectually provocative - A difficult creature to build indeed.
fresh	The best thing about "Ex Machina" is the robotic depiction of Ava, a sleek humanoid that exudes sex appeal.
fresh	Slow paced, but thought provoking science fiction.
fresh	A thrilling work of sci-fi ... a smart and visually alluring film that contemplates chilling questions about where technology is headed and the consequences of playing God.
fresh	Beautifully haunting.
fresh	With Ex Machina writer/director Alex Garfield delivers a science fiction film full of concepts and ideas versus overblown visual effects.
fresh	Like Ava herself, Garland manipulates our sympathies, rendering his climax all the more horrifying and his denouement, albeit understated, terrifying.
fresh	This is the best, most credible, of the artificial intelligence movies to date. Garland keeps the tension up and the pace moving by tackling many thought-provoking existential issues. I was pleasantly surprised, rewarded, by what I had just seen.
rotten	The writer and director, Alex Garland, keeps the movie so full of doomy atmosphere that expecting the worst sort of becomes a treat. But gradually the hypnosis wears off, the mystique dissipates, and banalities take over.
fresh	Many movies...almost require a reverse Turing test - you can't quite believe they were written by humans, rather than number-crunching machines. I'm happy to say Ex Machina would pass.
fresh	A chilly yet engrossing drama, elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garland's screenplay.
fresh	Ex Machina achieves that rare combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings, and it deserves to be known as a sci-fi classic.
fresh	A TED Talk in the form of a movie, with a few creepy twists and suspenseful deceptions that keep the plot moving forward.
fresh	[O]ne of the finest sci-fi productions of the decade... as intellectually compelling as it is emotionally provocative.
fresh	Gleeson is terrific and Vikander, who stars in five other films this year alone, is a revelation. As is Ex Machina, a movie that looks like something destined to be savored, watched and re-watched endlessly over the years.
fresh	We will be very lucky if we get another movie either as good or better this year.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
fresh	[Blaire's] atrocious spelling and grammar will no doubt annoy purists, but speaks to how srsly stressed she is. And something as simple as a pointer hesitating or pacing between two windows provides its own window into her motivation.
fresh	As a harangue about cyberbullying, it's purely exploitative, but when "Unfriended" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives? It's srsly fun, imo.
rotten	A horror pic with a new gimmick that likely will spawn an entire subgenre of more substandard rubbish.
rotten	At times, "Unfriended" really clicks - but ultimately, it's a drag.
fresh	The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. It's supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest, but the movie is speaking the right language.
rotten	You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.
rotten	It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting, claustrophobic physical setting.
fresh	The best thing about "Unfriended," beyond its funny-nasty title, is that it doesn't play as remotely dull as it sounds even if most of the drama takes place inside shifting, overlapping windows.
fresh	Younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the film's underlying message ...
rotten	Unfriended just about evolves beyond its gimmick but it's still nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror flick.
rotten	Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no one's tried an idea before doesn't mean it's a great one.
fresh	A movie to be seen, if you can endure it-as a shrewd commercial venture, as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and, last and foremost, as a window on a mode of thinking that equates to a state of being.
rotten	The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable, yet unmotivated, character turns. There's no one to root for, not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough.
fresh	Fresh and fearsome fun.
rotten	I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood, or some sort of natural disaster. Aren't the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time?
rotten	One of the rare occasions where an aesthetic decision drives the experience... It lacks in the legitimate fear department, however.
fresh	Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015.
rotten	Unfriended should be applauded for addressing a very serious issue in today's culture of anonymity-driven public shaming, but the fact that it's surrounded by so much stupidity weakens its message.
fresh	It's a mean, potent little movie.
fresh	It looks just beneath the surface of today's technology and discovers a place crawling with terrors all its own.
fresh	The filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick, turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process, they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.
fresh	It's interesting to wonder how the film will age, given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem, technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.
fresh	Though not particularly ground-breaking-last year's Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick, and much more ambitiously-we're still going to "like" the result.
rotten	Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze, "Unfriended" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along.
fresh	It's basically Friday the 13th on a laptop, but the gimmick works like gangbusters. One request: Please Hollywood cybergods, no sequels.
fresh	It will be interesting after Unfriended ends its theatrical run and it can be viewed on a home computer. That will create the unsettling situation where the viewer is almost a new participant in this online game of supernatural cyberstalking.
fresh	It will surely cut close to the bone for many, as all the best horror movies do.
fresh	This isn't great cinema, folks. It's more of a novelty. But it's a cleverly constructed novelty.
fresh	"Unfriended" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But it's clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then ...
rotten	Unfriended proves that you absolutely can make a movie that unfolds entirely on a computer. The question it doesn't answer is why you'd want to.
fresh	Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 you'll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when, even if you're not a cyberbullying white teen.
fresh	We need these teens to click clearly diseased links and bicker with one another while a ghost eggs them on. It's ridiculous, but when executed this competently, the absurd becomes riveting.
fresh	A great gimmick, but uncinematic and not as scary as you'd hope.
fresh	Neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its "Titus Andronicus"-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises, it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can.
fresh	It hates millenials so much it could have been made by Ben Stiller's documentarian in 'While We're Young.'
fresh	...a modern take on Scream for the Skype generation.
fresh	While it's not a flawless fright flick, Unfriended gives us a good gimmick as byte-sized horror that's easy to 'like' before moving onto the next distraction.
fresh	Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre.
fresh	Simultaneously clever and exasperating.
fresh	This is a movie for savvy Internet kids, and it feels savvy itself. Unlike so many other movies that make this attempt and feel ancient, [Unfriended] feels current.
rotten	In the end one would rather be back at one's own computer, tending to the tedious details of digital life, than watching this clique get pinged to death.
fresh	A clever spin on the found footage genre, and a tight little horror flick that's good for a solid scare or two.
fresh	Writer Nelson Greaves and director Levan Gabriadze do a decent job of creating genuine tension within the almost theatrical, proscenium-like arrangement of the computer screen.
fresh	When the genre-film spectacle arrives, it's in full force, and the strictures of the framing device manage to amplify, rather than suppress, the impact of the shocks and scares.
rotten	"Unfriended" is diverting and energetic and should be awarded points for attempting to be the Facebook generation's "Ringu," but it fails to create memorable characters and is awash in tired cliches and muddy mythology.
fresh	None of the slasher stuff is anywhere near as disturbing as the routine cruelty of the actual internet.
fresh	It's a gimmick movie, and like most gimmick movies [it] sometimes bends over backwards to make it work. But like the best gimmick movies the conceit never gets boring, and it actually has something pointed to say.
fresh	Unfriended is a terrifying cyber nightmare for today's generation of laptop-loving teenagers who think trolls are the worst thing the internet has to offer.
fresh	Unfriended is a smart, thrilling, and addicting byte of horror that's worth thinking about. It'll be awhile before your mind hits CTRL + ALT + DEL on this one
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant.
rotten	Again and again, director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste & Jesse Forever) allows shades of a more nuanced movie to pop up along the margins, only to steer instead toward innocent niceties.
rotten	It fails to pursue any of the fascinating questions its premise raises. Instead, it dives headfirst into Nicholas Sparks territory and explores, though not without some charm, Adaline's romantic life.
fresh	Okay, it's hooey. "Adaline" is not a documentary. What it is, though, is seductive.
fresh	Adaline's secret is a dramatization of the vulnerability we all resist, and so her love story isn't so much cosmic in its significance as it is miraculous in its familiarity.
rotten	You can't really call The Age of Adaline a movie. It's more like a series of pretty pictures held together by a remarkably idiotic story.
fresh	The movie is so free of irony, so quaint and earnest in its philosophy and metaphysics, that it's a refreshing alternative to this season's loud, marketing-approved, studio-built tentpoles.
fresh	The Age of Adaline may be preposterous, but it's unabashedly, sentimentally so.
rotten	During its second half, in which we meet Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker, cast as Ellis' parents, it all turns to caramel and its absurdities can no longer be denied.
rotten	A supernatural romance that thinks itself far more profound than it actually is.
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
rotten	A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
fresh	Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
fresh	A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best kind of speculative fiction: its action is brisk, its characters startling, and its meanings multifarious.
fresh	Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
fresh	Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
fresh	It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
rotten	Alex Garland has written some of the best science fiction films of this century, so it's startling to see him succeed more as a director than as a writer here.
fresh	Most movies don't pass the smell test, let alone the Turing Test, but "Ex Machina" aces both with the sort of intelligence -- artificial or otherwise -- often absent from contemporary sci-fi.
fresh	The Swedish actress Alicia Vikander ("The Fifth Estate") infuses Ava with the just the right mixture of iciness, vulnerability and mystery. It's a star-making performance.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction, and it's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness.
rotten	Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements.
rotten	Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects.
fresh	A perfectly amiable and often funny animation feature aimed largely at children but not childish or pandering in any way.
fresh	Although it may not be where the heart is, Home is a functional escape and shelter.
rotten	Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable.
fresh	Home's incongruously humble vibe works well for what's at heart a buddy road movie.
rotten	Sadly, Home feels very derivative, borrowing heavily from Lilo and Stitch, Despicable Me and several recent DreamWorks features.
rotten	The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that "Home" would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about.
fresh	When we scratch beneath the sugary surface, there's something tart inside that's difficult to digest.
rotten	Lazy gags, and it's been done better elsewhere.
fresh	This kiddie sci-fi adaptation doesn't quite live up to its evocative title.
fresh	I brought a couple of my kids, who liked it fine and found the friendship at the center rather affecting.
rotten	The feature doesn't connect in a significant way, reduced to a series of skits, poo-poo, pee-pee jokes, and commercials for the soundtrack.
fresh	Oh and Tip may not be the most memorable animated duo, but Parsons's high-pitched squeal and the groove in Rihanna's voice bounce off each other nicely.
rotten	While watching "Home," a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
fresh	You could do a lot better in the kid-film arena than this, but you could also do a Smek of a lot worse.
rotten	DreamWorks movies are often about outsiders learning that they don't have to fit in, a lesson the filmmakers may not have absorbed themselves.
rotten	Only mildly annoying.
rotten	The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D.
rotten	Like the timorous Boov, "Home" has little interest in risk-taking.
rotten	Home cunningly attempts to achieve that always-expected animated feat of being everything to everyone, but what it really proves -- with more authenticity than the content itself can muster -- is just how infrequently that can be done.
rotten	Racial diversity and girl power are dandy, but they cannot compensate for uninspired material.
fresh	Aimed squarely at eight-and-unders.
fresh	As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm.
fresh	Home doesn't sparkle enough to make the transition from kids film to modern classic... That said, Home is possibly the most cheerful alien-invasion-of-Earth film you're likely to see.
rotten	An earnest exercise that falls flat, despite the best of intentions.
fresh	"Home" is a solid double in a time when DreamWorks really needs a home run.
rotten	Home marks a throwback to the hyperactive, pop culture-fixated DreamWorks of old, where star power alone pushes straight-to-VOD material into theatres
rotten	Home's exposition is a mess of forced zaniness, which leaves the rest of the film with a Swiss-cheese foundation.
rotten	Steve Martin has fun as the pompous Captain Smek, but this remains little more than colourfully inoffensive.
fresh	Home has an original, convincingly satirical concept at its heart, but much of the execution feels overly familiar.
rotten	It's good, clean, harmless fun.
fresh	A pastel-coloured visual delight with an emphasis on soft-edges and bubbles, director Tim Johnson (Antz; Over the Hedge) aims the film squarely at kids who won't mind the regular overdoses of touchy-feely cheese.
rotten	...more than likely going into the DreamWorks pile of films you won't remember in five years time.
fresh	ET meets Lilo & Stitch in this sweet, screwball culture clash comedy adapted from Adam Rex's children's novel The True Meaning of Smekday.
rotten	This bowls along amiably enough, boosted by some astonishing visuals, but is let down by a gossamer-thin script and uninspired characters.
rotten	Home is schematic and moralistic in the frequent manner of modern American cartoons, although the moralising doesn't entirely make sense: there are a couple of underlying metaphors that don't quite mesh.
fresh	The film combines wit with mind-boggling inanity but is so brash and good-natured that it is very hard to dislike.
rotten	The film takes the lazy route of cannibalising pop cultural references rather than coming up with decent jokes.
fresh	An entertaining odd-couple comedy on very traditional lines ...
rotten	Animation has become a crowded field, and perhaps we shouldn't always expect something out of this world, but this underdeveloped offering barely lifts itself off the drawing board. It's very, very...oh.
rotten	Mostly harmless.
rotten	Home does very little to be interesting or original.
fresh	A sharp script and especially colourful imagery make this animated romp a lot more fun than expected, entertaining grown-ups just as much as the kids...
fresh	Science fiction with training wheels, fine for sucking the kiddies into geekery but with little appeal for grownup fans of animated genre adventure.
rotten	Inoffensive but flavourless, and crammed with familiar elements from better movies like  Lilo and Stitch ,  Toy Story  and  Despicable Me .
rotten	Home's infantilism is a regressive step for DreamWorks, offering a sour rather than sweet experience for audiences.
fresh	Adapted from Adam Rex's novel in praise of family and friends, Antz director Tim Johnson's film is original and fresh, with an easy to understand narrative that finds its endearing protagonist Oh on a journey that takes him from zero to hero
rotten	There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like Home, an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar.
fresh	The story has a pleasant warmth to it - together with a vague message about individuality and tolerance - and Parsons does a terrific job bringing the charmingly open-hearted Oh to life.
rotten	From a creative standpoint, this is the studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Dragon."
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
fresh	If it helps convey zoological and ecological lessons to children with short attention spans, then so be it.
fresh	All in all, this is one of Disneynature's best in-country outings so far, so much so that you're very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.
fresh	Engaging live-action eco-documentary, combining education with entertainment...
fresh	Monkey Kingdom moves so smoothly and quickly that the filmmakers' time-consuming dedication and labor-intense toil stays, as it should be, invisible.
fresh	It might be tempting to roll your eyes at the Disney-ness of it all. Then again, maybe it's that Disney-ness that keeps you watching all the way to that happy ending in the first place.
fresh	This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it's also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.
fresh	The filmmakers bring us to places and creatures we would never see otherwise, so we get education along with the entertainment
fresh	Tina Fey-narrated monkey documentary is funny, educational.
fresh	You'll wish the narrative could be as au naturel as the photography, but Monkey Kingdom makes for pleasantly diverting eco-tainment.
fresh	While previous entries in this series have been over-anthropomorphized, defanged and declawed, Mark Linfield & Alastair Fothergill's ("Earth," "Chimpanzee") latest is a winner with an organically spun story
fresh	This latest production showcases lavish, breathtaking cinematography, in addition to heartwarming stories about the inhabitants of these gorgeous lands.
fresh	It's a wondrous way for the whole family to spend 81 minutes. And most importantly, part of your ticket purchase during opening week goes to protecting this endangered species.
fresh	It pretty closely follows the Disneynature formula, so don't expect anything groundbreaking. You can, however, expect a sweet and entirely enjoyable all-ages delight.
fresh	Another winning entry in Disneynature's collection of easily accessible documentaries. (Full Content Review -- Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	You're likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.
fresh	An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...
fresh	Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.
fresh	The story of the colony's exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.
rotten	Assess to what extent we're witnessing man-ufactured monkey life...[or] just pay no attention to the men and women behind the curtain and simply enjoy the underwater photography of monkeys swimming.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is beautifully shot by co-directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who each have a slew of nature-doc credits to their names.
fresh	Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney's long tradition of nature family films.
rotten	Disneynature's documentaries have proven to be exquisite to watch, but time and again, they falter, if not fail outright, at telling stories without getting in their own way.
fresh	The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining.
fresh	You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya's lil' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.
fresh	It's been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. "Monkey Kingdom" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.
fresh	As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature's eight features.
rotten	It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.
fresh	Monkeys.
fresh	The lead monkeys are such an engaging trio, and the filmmakers are so successful in capturing them in vibrant images,that family audiences will probably be charmed, if not enthralled.
fresh	Everything Monkey Kingdom lacks in scientific rigor, it makes up for in pure entertainment value-and then some.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature's low point thus far, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great time.
fresh	Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, "Monkey Kingdom" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe's complicated social hierarchy ...
fresh	What we witness in Monkey Kingdom is nothing less than amazing.
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian "Cinderella."
fresh	"Monkey Kingdom" isn't going to be mistaken for science, but it's extremely entertaining.
fresh	If you don't love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then "Monkey Kingdom" will swing you in the right direction.
fresh	You couldn't do much better than "Monkey Kingdom" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.
fresh	An engaging, kid-friendly nature doc with a hint of social commentary rolled in.
fresh	Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you'll see in this year's summer blockbusters ...
fresh	The imagery of this film will linger in this reviewer's mind long after the monkey names are forgotten.
fresh	With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, "Monkey Kingdom" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people.
fresh	The cumulative effect is cheerily life-affirming, a bracing infusion of macaque-style joie de vivre.
fresh	The cheekiest, funniest, and most purely entertaining entry in the Disneynature series.
fresh	The film should hit the sweet spot for family audiences.
fresh	A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.
fresh	Outrageously funny, though often bordering on bad taste.
rotten	Moviegoers aren't supposed to ask whether the jokes are in poor taste because the cast is so diverse, so everyone must approve, right? Even if you buy that logic, it doesn't excuse the poor execution.
rotten	Get Hard doesn't busy itself with being particularly innovative or original and instead either bastardizes or quotes much, much better films.
rotten	You're going to see certain things in most Will Ferrell movies, and 'Get Hard' is no exception:
fresh	The laughs are down to Ferrell and Hart, who hold the thing together.
rotten	Instead of carefully and smartly constructing the material on offer, they take the decidedly more amateur approach here of throwing up every gag they can think of on the wall.
rotten	Let's pretend prison rape jokes are funny (they're not) and cheap homophobia jokes are funny (also not). Even with all those concessions? Get Hard still isn't that funny.
rotten	Will Ferrell's one-note performances are becoming a bit tiring. The film plays lightly on the idea of racial stereotyping, but it just isn't funny enough to qualify as any sort of satire or penetrating social comment.
fresh	I laughed quite a bit at this movie ... but, at the same time, it felt like it left a lot on the table resulting in a film that is merely a shell of what it could have been.
rotten	...an increasingly unpleasant comedy, wasting two very funny stars in a barrage of prison rape gags, lazy stereotypes, toilet stall indignities and insincere acceptance of people already marginalized in movies.
rotten	100 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum.
rotten	While the actors are certainly a more pleasing combination, Get Hard leaves a similarly nasty aftertaste.
rotten	It's hard to recall a movie with such a huge platform appearing to be so out of touch with society.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart strain to deliver the jokes
rotten	"Get Hard" is all the more repulsive because Farrell and Hart are overwhelmingly unfunny. The screenplay shoots for the lowest common denominator and succeeds. It's Easter come early, with eggs laid everywhere.
rotten	On paper, Get Hard might have been a prison riot, but on screen, lazy writing turns it into a longer-than-necessary letdown.
rotten	Ferrell and Hart work tirelessly to stay on their feet as the comedic ground crumbles underneath them and their talent.
rotten	Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart work diligently to soften the movie's mean spirit.
rotten	Offensive on many levels, even before you factor in the ironic (but not really) racial banter between Ferrell and Hart - or the sleazy objectification of some of its (minor) female characters.
rotten	A confused and contradictory mess.
rotten	This will be tagged racist by some and commended for puncturing racism by others. There are a number of choice bits, yet for every couple of gags that work, there's one that falls flat. The odds when it comes to the homophobic material are even worse.
rotten	One may be patient with raunchy stupidity - but not with those who are proud of it.
rotten	I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.
rotten	If you think jokes about prison rapes are funny, you might enjoy this movie. If not, steer clear.
rotten	Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star, even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man.
fresh	Get Hard is like a flaccid dick standing with the assistance of two splints; Ferrell and Hart.
rotten	Dumb, juvenile comedy has its place when it's funny. Unfortunately, too often in Get Hard, it's not.
rotten	Get Hard has grand ambitions, packaging trenchant social commentary in a crass R-rated comedy. But it's undermined by a blind eye toward homophobia.
fresh	The combined power of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is enough to make Get Hard's raunchy and juvenile look at prison life a whole lot of depraved fun.
fresh	It's really nothing more than a raunchy comedy. And that's okay. It made me laugh.
rotten	From its juvenile double entendre title to its fascination with prison rape and homophobic humor, "Get Hard" practically announces itself as an offensive, tired and unimaginative comedy in nearly every scene.
rotten	'Get Hard's' affability barely outweighs its offensive stereotypes.
fresh	A crude farce based on racial stereotypes, homophobia, and prison rape. Get Hard is incredibly stupid and juvenile...but I laughed, I laughed enough to recommend it.
rotten	The film feels like a 100-minute prison rape joke.
rotten	Feels like someone had a great pitch for a smart, satirical comedy about race that got greenlit so fast he had to try to write it on the car ride to the set.
rotten	Kevin Hart gives his all, but infectious energy does little to rescue the heavy-handedness of Get Hard.
rotten	If the silly, juvenile double-entendre title isn't enough to warn you,...this is an enormously dispiriting movie. I'd like to see Will Ferrell devote his God-given talent to uplifting erudite comedies instead of this unfunny jejune low class junk.
rotten	Comedy needn't be PC. But being offensive isn't funny, either.
rotten	The director Etan Cohen neither gets the best out of his two leads nor manages to give his story much of a satirical or political kick.
fresh	It's a modestly entertaining burlesque that might have been more upsetting if it weren't at least somewhat offensive. It adeptly satirizes racism and, less successfully, homophobia.
fresh	Get Hard packs an impressive gag-rate into its fairly thin premise.
rotten	With such a promising premise at its center, Get Hard could have been scathingly, satirically funny, a kind of 48 HRS meets Trading Places for moderns, but, oh, man, it's not.
rotten	It trucks in stereotypes (black, white, Latino, female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still, the movie's greatest and altogether familiar sin is that it's stupid.
rotten	Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist.
rotten	Maybe, in a less enlightened time, Get Hard would seem like a scathing satire. As it plays today, however, it's more embarrassing than entertaining.
rotten	It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years, and they've crammed them all into one film - with tiresome results.
fresh	Get Hard is not only a lot smarter than you think, but also Will Ferrell's funniest film since 2008&#8242;s Step Brothers... & Kevin Hart's best performance on screen so far...
rotten	It can't find much of a tone, and it's neither sharply constructed, nor is it reckless or anarchic.
fresh	"Get Hard" does have a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of priceless scenes. But, as with most comedies lately, it has more than its share of cringe-inducing shots,
rotten	The thin material by a gaggle of writers does not sustain the laughs. Perhaps there's too much emphasis on James hiding homemade shivs "where the sun don't shine".
fresh	Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes.
rotten	It's hard to find anything remotely funny or fun about Get Hard.
fresh	Audiences may be divided over whether this comedy crosses the line as it looks for laughs in racism and homophobia, but...
rotten	Humor often is in bad taste and isn't politically correct, but "Get Hard" takes the wrong tack on the wrong issues at the wrong time.
fresh	If you put this movie on a set of scales, I think the laughs do outweigh the non-laughs. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	If you love rape jokes, "Get Hard" is your movie.
rotten	A blast of scattershot raunch, you say? The star bares his pasty butt? Is it a Will Ferrell movie?
fresh	Get Hard gets the job done, but I feel sad for the loss of what could have been.
fresh	Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.
fresh	[An] occasionally hilarious and constantly filthy comedy featuring more penis references than a PhD in human biology.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches.
fresh	"Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
fresh	Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious.
fresh	We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
fresh	Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film.
fresh	... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ...
rotten	More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh.
rotten	...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
fresh	(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
fresh	A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
fresh	('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
fresh	Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch.
rotten	We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
fresh	The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
rotten	Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
fresh	Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
fresh	Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
rotten	Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
fresh	Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
fresh	On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
fresh	The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World.
fresh	The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
rotten	At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either.
rotten	Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
fresh	Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh	Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
fresh	For the most part, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed.
fresh	Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
fresh	A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
fresh	At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
fresh	The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
fresh	For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
fresh	The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second.
rotten	World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
fresh	Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution.
rotten	Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
fresh	The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
fresh	Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records.
fresh	Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
fresh	Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
rotten	Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
rotten	The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners.
fresh	Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
fresh	[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
fresh	The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
fresh	You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm.
fresh	The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
fresh	If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
fresh	This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
fresh	It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an "event" every time it's on, you know?
fresh	Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
fresh	A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
fresh	If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered.
fresh	The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This is a silver plate for the diehards of MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow.
fresh	Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
fresh	It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	Definitely an efficient blockbuster, you will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... however it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]
fresh	This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity.
rotten	A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances.
rotten	By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead.
rotten	Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten	What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused.
fresh	Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a "near miss," content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy.
fresh	The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal.
rotten	The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material.
fresh	An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base.
rotten	This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, "Um, we have a big problem with this story"?
fresh	A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh	A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point.
rotten	Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh	Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten	It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so.
fresh	There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie.
fresh	The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too.
rotten	This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten	Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material.
fresh	Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford.
fresh	A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide.
fresh	Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life.
rotten	Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten	Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten	Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens.
rotten	The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic.
fresh	a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character.
rotten	For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.
rotten	Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop.
fresh	The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle.
fresh	Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh	I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
fresh	Burstyn is as beautiful and emotionally present as always and Ford - after so many years of grumpily picking up paychecks - seems delighted to be acting again, and in a real movie.
rotten	Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!
rotten	Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten	[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten	For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - "The Age of Adaline" doesn't have a lot of wisdom.
fresh	[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so.
rotten	What eventually saves "Adaline" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through.
rotten	[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh	Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, "The Age of Adaline" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism.
fresh	Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection.
fresh	A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh	The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past.
fresh	Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration.
fresh	With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike.
rotten	Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience.
rotten	a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh	...while the effects shots and stunt work keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't shake that feeling that it's all one Wile E. Coyote gag from a Looney Tunes cartoon.
rotten	... a handful of dazzling action set pieces and impressive stunts will delight fans, even if they don't make much narrative sense or contain much subtlety or surprise.
fresh	Either get out of the way or go along for the ride
fresh	To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies.
fresh	A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process.
rotten	The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery.
fresh	Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan
fresh	Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity.
fresh	If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun.
fresh	A captivating combination of camaraderie and cartoon physics tempered by just enough nostalgia to tug at your heartstrings.
fresh	Once you've defeated gravity in one scene, why not just keep doing it?
fresh	The victory lap of Furious 7 proves there's still plenty of gas left in the tank.
fresh	Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit.
rotten	Wan and Morgan, stuffing another plot into the main plot like a cinematic turducken, justify a series of jaw-dropping car stunts in settings such as Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.
rotten	With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?
fresh	Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see.
fresh	Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that "Furious Seven" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill.
fresh	It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps.
fresh	Rev your engines... and grab the tissues. Furious 7 delivers the same outrageous thrill ride you expect , but tears will also flow for the late Paul Walker.
rotten	7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies.
rotten	Along with all of the nonsense, Furious 7 is built on a series of forced dialogues and a bad mix of different movie genres that make the story hard to believe.
fresh	The special effects are simply spectacular.
fresh	It's becoming increasingly hard to outright dismiss this franchise, even if every nuanced critical bone in my body would love to do so.
fresh	The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant but Furious 7 is undone by a misogynistic streak that runs all the way through the movie and director James Wan's relentless objectification of its female characters.
fresh	The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie's real subject is the stunt work, but its stars' authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat.
fresh	Explosive, spectacular and surprisingly touching, Episode 7 is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.
fresh	'Furious Seven' is not the best movie in the series. It is a fine farewell tribute to (Paul) Walker and a dizzying popcorn feature.
fresh	The film-makers give Paul Walker and his Brian O'Conner character a graceful farewell - perhaps that's what's most memorable.
fresh	While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and "holy crap that was incredible!!!" chapter yet.
fresh	It's flying cars and explosions. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Bang Bang.
fresh	I'm not ashamed to say (ok, maybe a little) that I cried like a baby at the end - but I didn't ugly cry. A perfect ending to this 7 film ride and they should just stop now and leave on a high note.
fresh	The action sequences are ridiculously over-the-top... but they're done in a semi-comedic way that is still entertaining.
fresh	A deafening orgy of explosions, car chases, well-polished bumpers (human and automotive), explosions, fist-fights and more explosions.
fresh	As zippy, playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models.
fresh	Yes, it's just more junk in the trunk, but it sure leaves your heart racing.
fresh	"Furious 7" could have come across as ghoulish, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect.
fresh	While the story ran out of steam long ago, there's plenty of action and excitement that kept the engine going. Another fun ride and first rate entertainment.
fresh	The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end.
fresh	For now, let's just marvel at how much mileage the studio has gotten out of what are basically 1950s-style "B" programmers supercharged for contemporary audiences.
fresh	The ending of Furious 7 is downright touching...
fresh	Spectacular stunts, a touching send-off for Paul Walker and pedal-to-the-metal action make this one furiously good - best in the series so far.
fresh	It's Dom's story -- so fun and funny and exhilaratingly over the top -- that resonates.
rotten	Furious 7 is louder and crazier than the previous films, but crazy in a sense that is borderline mentally ill. Its brainless and senseless action is almost as offensive as its terrible jabs at humor.
rotten	I have now seen all of the Rapido y Furioso movies, and I can recall almost no salient details about any of them.
fresh	Rather than simply ignoring physics, it downright defies physics with what we see happen on screen. The result is a giant Looney Tunes car chase for more than two hours.
rotten	It remains a reliably entertaining series but if its to go on much longer those in creative control will have to sit down and think hard about how to give future sequels more life than pyrotechnic polish.
fresh	Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars.
rotten	A tedious, vapid and over-produced bore that will surely please the shallow masses who are unashamedly entertained by bread and circuses.
fresh	Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?
fresh	It's bananas -- a loud, crackpot joyride and you'll love every messed-up minute of it.
fresh	The gloriously idiotic, jingoism-tinged pro wrestling morality play that Michael Bay has been trying to make for his entire career.
fresh	James Wan ("The Conjuring") steps out of his genre to supervise traffic and he does an excellent job.
fresh	This whole series is little more than adolescent boy wish fulfillment; and as a former adolescent boy that is cool with me.
fresh	A tactful and touching legacy for Paul Walker, "Furious 7" is a relentlessly action-packed thrill ride that actually has a story, too. Its fun is propelled by characters you give a frick about even if you've never called yourself a franchise fan before.
fresh	Furious 7 is another solid Fast and the Furious installment - one that (flaws aside) provides a nice farewell to star Paul Walker.
fresh	The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
fresh	Takes no names. Saves no places... The racing franchise continues bigger and better...
rotten	Has a lot of the same problems as its most recent predecessors. The dialogue is flat, the action scenes are over-edited so that it's not always clear what you're looking at, and situations often get so implausible that it becomes a distraction.
fresh	Furious 7 is undeniably satisfying and mostly fun. More than pure escapism, however, it also serves as a fitting tribute to its costar Paul Walker, who was killed in a car accident while on a break during filming.
rotten	James Wan directs Furious 7 like a boy tossing his Matchbox cars and action figures down the steps.
rotten	Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold.
fresh	It doesn't break new ground in any way, but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough.
rotten	If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is playing you only have yourself to blame.
rotten	Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake, that's hardly a recommendation.
fresh	A perfectly congenial, innocuous goofball comedy. It's not as funny as the first film, but it is funny enough...this chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory; it is difficult to figure out why.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero. Why should we?
rotten	There are mediocre films, and then there are films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, where the mediocrity is more or less the point.
fresh	No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself.
rotten	The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be forgettable, but it's difficult to truly dislike.
rotten	This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film, the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.
rotten	A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 never gets further than the fertilizer.
rotten	During Blart's awkward convention speech, a fellow security guard is so inspired, she yells out, "You go Paul Blart!" Yes, Paul Blart. You go. And take everybody involved with this mess with you.
rotten	Kevin James and Nick Bakay are credited as screenwriters, but that's only because "Taking Naps" and "I Went Out To Get A Sandwich" are not Writer's Guild credits yet.
rotten	A movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas.
rotten	You won't find much offensive in Kevin James's slick, innocuous vehicle Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. You won't find much prompting an emotional reaction in general, so familiar are the jokes and situations.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 takes a page from the Think Like A Man Too playbook by moving its sequel to Las Vegas, and a page from seemingly every other bad sequel by essentially remaking the original.
rotten	The plot is full of gaps in logic, motivation, physics and chemistry. Characters show up and vanish again as randomly as the targets in a game of Whac-a-Mole.
rotten	Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Speed 2. To this small sample of the ever-expanding list of wretched movie sequels, add Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, a gobsmackingly witless excuse for entertainment.
rotten	The proceedings are at their best when focusing on Blart's relationship with his daughter, but sadly that human element is forced to take a backseat to Blart's stopping a heist.
rotten	Far from the worst movie that you'll ever see, but you might leave wondering why you, the people on the screen, or anyone else in the theater even bothered.
rotten	Die-hard Kevin James fans will get additional mileage from it, but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a pretty easy pass for everyone else.
rotten	It is listless, boring and as flat to the floor as Paul Blart when he slams down in a coma or gets knocked down by a villain, a vehicle or a horse's hind hoof.
rotten	Like the first movie, Mall Cop 2 suffers from indifferent plotting and apathetic jokes that often don't appear to have punchlines.
rotten	Nothing here is remotely salvageable
rotten	The cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.
rotten	Truly, there is not a single redeeming moment in director Andy Fickman's film. A general flatness and lethargy permeates these reheated proceedings.
rotten	Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless?
rotten	Even with six years of preparation, the sequel feels slapdash, too reliant on James to bring the funny, and he's clearly struggling throughout this awkward return engagement.
rotten	There was a point where I was considering writing a will because this film made me want to leave this Earth.
rotten	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a boring, lifeless, lazily written movie with Kevin James' cheap, slapstick gags repeated ad nauseam.
rotten	More slapstick humor; strongest appeal for Kevin James fans.
rotten	Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel.
rotten	James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs.
rotten	Your enjoyment (or not) of the material will depend solely on whether you find James' portrayal of this character entertaining. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Even the title is lazy.
rotten	Tragically unfunny. More of an excuse to promote the Wynn resort than a real movie.
rotten	It's like Die Hard if Bruce Willis was overweight, socially inept, clumsy, and kind of dimwitted.
rotten	This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough.
rotten	The theater echoes with the sounds...of silence.
rotten	It takes approximately thirty seconds for Kevin James and Nick Bakay to undo any existing good will viewers might have for its predecessor. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2" succeeds only at being aggravating.
rotten	It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
rotten	Here's our list of 20 things that aren't quite as bad as Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.
rotten	A soulless sequel. [full review in Spanish]
rotten	It's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that Blart is an overweeningly horrible character. What rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a moustache and wheels.
rotten	Hard to believe, I know, but this is a real movie that real people have unashamedly put their names to. Because a sweet paycheck trumps human dignity.
rotten	So mordantly witless that it takes on the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy.
rotten	What would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible?
rotten	This failure is a little surprising given the celebrity voice talent involved, but it proves even great actors need a substantive script.
rotten	Home is a blithering mess, devoid of internal narrative logic, mired in obnoxious humor, and so poorly paced that its 94 minute run-time felt like it was over two hours long.
fresh	It's a family-friendly movie about, well, family.
rotten	Even by DreamWorks standards, the celebrities in this go-round are especially awful, and the music cues particularly distracting.
fresh	Again, there is nothing all that terrible about this movie (unless you find Parsons' voice to be grating, then you are in big trouble) but you might be overwhelmed by its averageness.
rotten	Home is where my heart wasn't, at a screening where even children didn't seem excited to be. The father snoring next to me had the right idea at the wrong volume. Hiding a catnap behind 3-D glasses only works if you don't give yourself away.
rotten	The kindest word that comes to mind is "undistinguished." Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying...
rotten	A few nods and winks don't add enough adult appeal to Home
fresh	"Home" is a fine selection for a second quarter film and a great choice for your children.
rotten	Kids will be entertained by the perpetual motion of Home, while most adults in the theater will tune out or glance at the watch every few minutes.
rotten	Familiarly fanciful, featuring the most benign aliens ever to invade Earth.
rotten	Heartwarming and harmless? Sure, why not. But it's also numbing in its simplicity and often rather annoying.
fresh	'Home' is cheerfully aimed for youngsters, mainly those under 10. It's simplistic and slapstick. It doesn't make any original or profound statements.
fresh	It's like being conquered by accountants.
rotten	Home is more of a blip than an alert, more of a whisper than a bang.
fresh	Home is a colorful and entertaining CGI adventure, but weighed down by an uneven and shallow story, falls short of animated greatness.
fresh	the most adorable alien invasion you'll likely see
fresh	The combination of Home's layered message, fun score, and clever comedy make it a colorful choice for moviegoers of any age.
rotten	Anyone over 10 will see the plot twists a mile away. Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music. Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
rotten	Another conspicuously packaged product seemingly designed to wear down an audience more than entertain it. While wee ones won't notice, they probably won't remember Home by the time the car ride gets them back to the real thing.
fresh	A surprisingly moving tale of friendship and family, dressed up as an adorably frivolous sci-fi comedy.
fresh	It's not pixel-pushing artistry in DreamWorks Animation's latest that will win over audiences, rather it's the film's timeless traits of sincerity and originality.
fresh	"Home" is a truly lovely and adorable film to attend with children, though doing so is not a requirement. I have a feeling Oh will be with us for a long time.
fresh	Savor "Home" for its vibrant colors, animated effects, like the upside-down Eiffel Tower floating over Paris, and the rapidly building, feel-good relationship between Oh and Tip.
fresh	...a nice message for kids on empathy and open mindedness.
fresh	Animated alien comedy is sweet, cute, if not super original.
fresh	It's not home sweet home but Home is a pretty good family flick and it's short and tight enough to keep young kids from squirming in their seats.
rotten	It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	This Close Encounters of the Cowardly Kind-tale is a fun--albeit hit or miss--diversion.
rotten	Death by cuteness.
rotten	Parsons does everything he can to win over the audience, and Rihanna should stick to singing.
fresh	Maybe it's because kids sometimes feel like aliens in a grown-up world, but from E.T. and Elliott to Lilo and Stitch, pairing a child with a creature from outer space can prove to be a winning combination.
rotten	A big, fat happy meal of a movie ...
fresh	...a charming entertainment for children that should amuse the adults that have to accompany them.
fresh	Adorable and intensely creepy all at once. Despite what it may sound like, "Home" is, at its core, a movie about friendship, family and acceptance. It's really rather sweet. And ominous.
fresh	Cute and colorful movie with an important safety tip concerning one of the most destructive forces in the universe, hitting the dreaded "send to all."
fresh	Parsons delivers this tongue-twisting patter with a happy eagerness that is both amusing and ingratiating.
fresh	The second half of Home works with a solid and emotionally-satisfying ending. If only the whole movie was that way.
rotten	Aside from Parsons' initially amusingly mangled Yoda-like English, which gets a tad repetitive, Home doesn't stand out as fresh or particularly funny.
rotten	Tension is one of "Home's" biggest issues. There just isn't nearly enough of it. Story is another. Even a kids' movie needs more complexity and more invention.
rotten	The combination of a feeble script, unnecessary music montages, unlikable characters and so-so animation leave Home a close encounter of the dull kind.
fresh	Youngsters should be tickled pink by the colourful on-screen creations. Their elders; well, if you were a Boov you'd likely be the same shade of purple after the movie as before it.
fresh	A charming concoction with positive messages for younger children about conquering fears, understanding outsiders and knowing yourself.
fresh	Director Tim Johnson ("Over the Hedge") and his animators can't maintain this level of freshness throughout, but that's where Parsons and his goofy charm take over.
rotten	This is not the hit film that DreamWorks Animation was hoping for; if anything it will only signal more trouble for the studio. Hopefully they'll get back on their feet but "Home" certainly isn't going to help accomplish that.
fresh	It works moderately well thanks largely to the voice talents of Jim Parsons and, to a lesser extent, Steve Martin. Two droll dudes who put a fair share of funny into this animated picture.
rotten	a nice 80-minute infomercial for Rihanna's next LP
rotten	Tim Johnson ( Antz) has capitalized on DreamWorks' proprietary animation platform, Apollo to create a rich, intricate setting...But the technology doesn't save the film from falling flat on other levels.
rotten	[I]t turns out that the Boov are neither loveable nor likeable. In fact, they're kind of annoying.
rotten	The bland "Home" is a crash pad at best.
rotten	Running contrary to its message, the film seems content to fit in rather than stand out from its numerous predecessors on stage and screen.
fresh	The problems with the story are still present - this is most certainly not a feminist polemic - but one can't help but be caught up in Branagh's theatrical spirit.
fresh	If the young girl who sat in front of me is to speak for children everywhere, they are going to adore this film.
fresh	takes the all-too-familiar beats of the story and plumbs them for deeper levels of feeling and physicality, merging the sensual and the chaste in a way that is uniquely compelling in its experiential bliss
fresh	Cate Blanchett steals her stepdaughter Cinders's show.
fresh	Lily James shines as Cinderella. [She] plays Ella with the right balance of sweetness and sincerity. It's a genuine and charming performance; she carries the film very well.
fresh	Based on the classic fairy tale, but borrowing heavily from the 1950 film, Cinderella is enchanting, a wonderful and stylish film with a charming lead and emotional narrative.
fresh	Disney's first-class, straight-faced, irony-free, live-action remake of its own 1950 animated classic is a delightful explosion of colour, costumes, virtue and snarling...a truly beautiful film.
fresh	Above all else, the best reason I can give to see this film is Cate Blanchett. She's incredibly good as the evil stepmother.
rotten	After dehydrating the pulpy fun from a Marvel superhero and Tom Clancy spies, you can imagine how Branagh mishandles Cinderella, reverent and corny when a touch of mockery wouldn't hurt.
rotten	It's hard to see this new Cinders as anything more than a brand-based cash grab when its sole function is to succeed (and perhaps replace) a movie that's ageless.
fresh	Cinderella is nice and serviceable, with a refreshing lack of twists on its universally recognisable story.
fresh	For the adult viewer, one of the joys of the film is the presence of Cate Blanchett, gloriously gowned, evoking the great female movie stars of the past (Joan Crawford, Bette Davis) as the Wicked Stepmother.
fresh	Special effects, Cate Blanchett make a familiar tale entertaining
fresh	With enough respect to eschew the easy option of modernising it with a hip and radical make-over, it's kind enough to the characters to get round the problematic sexual politics of the story without making a big statement about them.
fresh	Hollywood filmmakers are no slouches these days when it comes to subverting or sending-up fairy-tale conventions. But Kenneth Branagh does something much more daring. He plays things straight.
fresh	There's plenty to like, and a little to love.
fresh	Branagh and company whip up a handsome slice of old-fashioned family entertainment.
fresh	Darlings, just breathless with the news: Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella is a sumptuous, candy-coloured rush of romance, with added thespian backbone from Cate Blanchett as the evil stepmother.
fresh	Chris Weitz's screenplay updates the old Charles Perrault yarn in a fresh and witty way. The performances are very lively too.
fresh	In its lack of experiment, this latest Cinderella does feel positively experimental.
fresh	This is the film of a full-blown romantic who believes in true love, happy endings and the importance of an absolutely fabulous wardrobe.
fresh	A remarkably faithful, full-hearted live action rendition of Cinderella, well cast and sumptuously staged, picking its way carefully between Walt Disney's classic musical animation of 1950 and Perrault's definitive text.
fresh	The thing that makes this Disney live-action remake so wonderful is the same thing that might put off some audience members: it's a pure fairy tale...
fresh	The story is as enchanting as ever, the handsome cast doesn't miss a beat, while the costumes and set design are wonders to behold. But the movie's sheer flawlessness turns out to be a flaw in itself.
fresh	With all (the recent) twisting and sculpting of classic stories, it's refreshing to watch ... Cinderella because it remains largely faithful.
fresh	Slightly eerie in its dead-eyed coldness, but you get used to it.
rotten	There is a lot of dying early on and also quite a lot later on, when you will feel you are dying, of boredom, of ennui and, possibly, the full weight of the patriarchy, pressing down hard on your chest.
fresh	It's good-natured and silly, with nice support from Rob Brydon, Nonso Anozie, Derek Jacobi and Katie West.
fresh	Delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Perfectly. Beautifully. Magically.
fresh	Witty, richly drawn and unashamedly old school, this is a smart adaptation that understands the enduring appeal of its source material, and doesn't feel the need to subvert or reinvent.
fresh	This is an enchantment - with the occasional touch of nostalgia - just the way it should be.
fresh	There are times, particularly when the bland Madden is on screen, that the wholesomeness gets a bit much. But kids will likely have a ball.
fresh	Sumptuously appointed and elegantly well-acted, looks and feels magical and should delight even the most skeptical cynic.
fresh	Kenneth Branagh's lavish live-action telling of the folktale made familiar to many by Disney's 1950 animated feature film is a faithful take that derives pleasure in updating expectations and absolutely never dashing them.
fresh	The result is a pleasant surprise, and just goes to show: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
fresh	The Cinderella fable is a lot like Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah": it's been covered.
fresh	I wanna go to Disneyland! I wanna go to Disneyland right now!
rotten	It looks terrific. It's also faithful to a fault -- and that's exactly the problem, since it makes it on the dull, unadventurous side.
rotten	The studio has managed to do the impossible, and portray a version of the classic fairy tale heroine who's even more of an insipid doormat that the one in its 1950 animated classic.
fresh	Branagh pulls off the same sort of trick he did with Thor: he creates a visually overwhelming, heavily gilded world, and then keeps the focus on the characters within it.
fresh	If the film belongs to anyone, however, it is Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother, looking as though she could lacerate someone with her cheekbones.
fresh	Disney's live action Cinderella benefits from Ken Branagh's kudos in being able to attract the kind of cast and achieving the kind of tone such a well known and loved fairy tale needs
fresh	There are many highlights, but none more memorable than when the clock strikes midnight ...It's a bumpy ride for the radiant Ella (Lily James) ...as the pumpkin bursts - just like her dreams
fresh	Embraces its fairy tale roots with impressive eye candy.
fresh	Much Magic at Play in this "Cinderella."
fresh	Branagh makes this familiar tale feel so fresh, even though you know exactly where it's going, staging it with the full-scale splendor of a period drama rather than a bedtime story.
fresh	No matter how cynical you might be -- hardened by the current climate of remakes, reboots and incessant sequels -- it's impossible to avoid getting caught up in the magic of a little Bippidy-boppidy-boo.
fresh	The actors in the film all give strong performances. This film is gorgeously staged with wonderful costumes, sets and production design. Scenic locations are expertly lensed by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos.
fresh	'Cinderella' is made of Disney magic.
fresh	What holds the audience is a dark undercurrent of not so much dread as uncertainty. Your senses tell you that something is off-kilter, yet you can't place your finger on what it is.
fresh	Borrowing body parts from the age old horror/sci-fi workbook, Alex Garland makes a female Frankenstein movie (sort of) and interrogates the pursuit of AI in the process
fresh	Although there's a fatal flaw that diminishes its overall satisfaction rating, this is a dazzling film filled with intrigue and an innate edginess that is elevated by three startlingly good performances
fresh	Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
fresh	The sharply written film is cerebral yet doesn't bog down in enigmatic concepts or scientific mumbo-jumbo.
fresh	Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
fresh	While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
fresh	Unlike most science fiction films, this one has smart characters, a smart plot and smart dialog. It also has romance, murder and suspense. This is a suspenseful, disturbing and thought-provoking film.
fresh	When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
fresh	It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
fresh	This really isn't the sort of movie in which we should talk about performances and plot.
fresh	Brainy sci-fi thriller.
fresh	The first homoerotic sci-fi thriller of the year!
fresh	While some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted, I was always interested to see where this story went.
fresh	A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
fresh	Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
fresh	A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
fresh	The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
fresh	Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
fresh	Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
fresh	Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
fresh	There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
fresh	It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
fresh	[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
fresh	For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
fresh	The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
fresh	Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
fresh	Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
fresh	A heady piece of sci-fi, fleshed out with terrific performances, a smart script, solid special effects & expert direction. So far, it's one of the best films of 2015. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
fresh	Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
fresh	Alex Garland's directorial debut ranks among my favorite movies this year.
fresh	A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
fresh	"Ex Machina" takes its time, wrestling with questions of responsibility, morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava, played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander.
fresh	While slowly paced, the feature isn't dull, emerging as a potent study of power and corruption, setting a sinister, tech-heavy atmosphere that almost seems achievable in our day and age.
fresh	At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
fresh	Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
fresh	It's a teasingly slow build -- part love story, part science experiment -- that makes a few of the movie's twists seem even more surprising.
fresh	[Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
fresh	Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
fresh	Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
fresh	This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
fresh	This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
fresh	Ex Machina is one of the smartest horror movies to come along in years. It doesn't count on big scares and excessive violence to make its points but shows that intellect left unchecked can be equally as frightening.
fresh	"Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
fresh	With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
fresh	A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
fresh	'Ex Machina' knows that cinema's dirty little secret has always been that it shares as much with porn as it does with literature.
fresh	It's great when a movie messes with your head.
fresh	A smart, entertaining sci-fi thriller with dazzling performances and clever psychological sparring, human and otherwise.
rotten	After tantalizing us with increasingly imaginative developments and the promise of catharsis, Garland lets it all dribble away at the end.
fresh	This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
fresh	To be able to tell a story from entirely within the narrative limitations of a few windows on a computer screen is actually quite an achievement.
rotten	This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media.
fresh	This is clever, even poignant stuff. Oldies as well as adolescents will find themselves intrigued.
fresh	[The film-makers'] greatest achievement in this high-end exploitation is to retain a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet
rotten	A gimmick is stretched beyond breaking point in an initially clever but ultimately exhausting horror film.
fresh	Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest.
rotten	In the cinema, the static setup, fuzzy, pixellating Skype faces, and the parps of incoming messages all become profoundly irritating.
fresh	For all its flaws, by injecting the sinister into something we are all familiar with, Unfriended manages to deliver a uniquely unnerving tone in a surprisingly traditional way.
fresh	Russian director Levan Gabriadze breathes digital life into the hackneyed "found footage" concept by placing the action in this revenge thriller solely on one teenage character's computer screen.
fresh	Unfriended is genuinely innovative and experimental.
rotten	Being up to date is not the same thing as being on the ball, and Unfriended could afford to be cleverer.
rotten	There's little less compelling than a vague evil spirit with loosely defined powers doing random 'scary' things as required by the script.
fresh	Credibly using actual programs rather than made-up ones, Unfriended makes hay with such cultural ephemera as the "memorialise" function for a Facebook account, which enables the pages of deceased friends to have an afterlife.
fresh	Unfriended is from a new generation: film-makers who now have the web in their bloodstream, for whom online interaction is a natural part of life. They've used a new language to create a smart, ingenious, subversive and scary movie.
fresh	The main achievement of this gimmicky horror is that it manages to hit all of the essential scary movie beats as the story unfolds in real time on a computer screen...
fresh	It does for Skype what The Blair Witch Project did for forests.
fresh	Even her Spotify account becomes possessed. Yes, the killer is calling from inside the house... music playlist.
rotten	It's well done but whether the concepts of betrayal as depicted by this nasty snuff revenge movie is a positive influence for the young target market, is questionable
fresh	Unfriended happens to be a pretty good time.
fresh	As a way of tackling the dark and disturbing side of social networking, this is a fair effort, with the cautionary aspect of bullying having consequences coming across effectively.
rotten	A series of disappointingly tame confrontations involving a lot of video interference and shrieking.
rotten	Painfully unscary.
rotten	Go home, Skype somebody, call them a name, and watch them rant and rave about it for 82 minutes. It would be more entertaining than this poor excuse for a movie.
rotten	You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you don't feel is sustained visceral fright.
fresh	Listen to the film's message: Don't cyberbully or you could unleash the ghost in the machine.
rotten	It's a very American-teen spook show, with the tired tropes of the unseen-slasher film firmly in place.
rotten	You might find yourself rooting for the murderer.
fresh	A Ghost in the Machine Haunts "Unfriended."
fresh	If you can give yourself over to the idea of Unfriended,you'll find it's surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever.
rotten	What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.
rotten	Even with an 82-minute running time, cracks start to show. One of the key problems with the script is that every single character is so utterly obnoxious and morally bankrupt that you start to relish their increasingly nasty deaths.
rotten	Flashy yet unnerving, delving into internet-obsessed teens' daily digital lives...
rotten	Stultifyingly stupid...It's dificult to care about the demise of characters in a horror movie when they're all already brain-dead.
fresh	Revenge as a dish best served pixilated!
fresh	... a cyber-chiller twist on Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None' ... creates a claustrophobic sense of inevitability even as it has us glancing nervously over our shoulder.
rotten	If you thought the shakey-cam hell of "found footage" horror was hard to take, prepare yourself for pixelated purgatory.
rotten	Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media "Scream" and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but "Unfriended" comes across as disdainful of millennials.
fresh	It's not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing, it's how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be, especially when they're being tinkered with.
fresh	Even though Unfriended begins to cheat, springing loud noises and gory cutaways that can't be explained, there's a rigor to its dopey, blood-simple conception that you might smile at.
rotten	Finally Hollywood has figured out how to get teens off the internet and into theatres. Make a movie that takes place ENTIRELY in front of a computer screen. But after 82 minutes you may feel a migraine coming on .
fresh	Unfriended is a spooky ghost story parable that will (only) be fun for those who grew up in the era of the online social jungle.
rotten	More of an interesting formal experiment than a successful narrative.
fresh	Delivers some truly unsettling jolts with a minimum of effects and what was surely a micro-fraction of the budget of much bigger, bloodier, more bloated horror flicks.
fresh	While the premise of being a voyeur to a private chat session sounds gimmicky, Unfriended's actually an innovative method to connect with a generation who've grown up online.
fresh	Translates horror conventions fluidly so that you hold your breath not when you're waiting for what's behind the door but for what's buffering.
rotten	The only thing more annoying than internet connectivity problems is seeing them simulated onscreen.
rotten	The premise and look of the film are admittedly innovative --- but this is not a scary movie.
fresh	Strangely enough, it works, and it can be quite gripping and chilling.
rotten	... A somewhat interesting experiment that ultimately fails.
rotten	while "Unfriended" is smart about how it uses the [online 'found' footage] device to tell its story, the story itself is poor programming.
fresh	Unfriended uses its subtle development of suspense to create genuine, well-earned scares, even if there are only a few.
rotten	Decidedly low-budget and low on true scares. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
fresh	Not only is Unfriended a much better film than you might have expected, it's a genuinely terrifying little ride and might just be a new horror classic.
rotten	Superficially, this is a horror movie, although its distinct lack of such important elements as mounting suspense and genuine scares forces us to think otherwise.
rotten	Unfriended is a by-the-numbers, scare-free slasher package that will likely test your patience for watching people yell at each other on Skype.
fresh	More than a cheap stunt.
fresh	If death invented the telephone, it probably invented the Internet infernal, too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we can't.
rotten	If it has a point about the way we treat people online, it's lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.
fresh	Doubling as a horror suspense for the social media generation and the world's most effective anti-cyber bullying PSA, it's a fun thriller until its disappointing final act.
rotten	The film still comes with the cheesy trademarks that you'd expect with a romantic drama such as this.
rotten	... doesn't disguise its efforts to peddle shamelessly sentimental melodrama to the author's legions of fans who make each successive film almost immune to criticism.
fresh	Sparks must be doing something right.
rotten	[The cast members] help make the inherently flavourless content that follows the initial meet-cute easier to consume -- though never to swallow whole.
rotten	The Longest Ride is a predictable romantic drama, with bad dialogue and a romance lacking the strength to be effective on screen, but in the end, it's just another Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	At the end, the movie is predictable and terribly tedious.
rotten	No one wanted this to be "The Notebook" as much as I did.
rotten	A quartet of burning hearts generate a serious case of heartburn for anyone attempting to stay atop the bucking bull of "The Longest Ride."
fresh	The Longest Ride is pretty darn tolerable - and sometimes even enjoyable - not just for fans but also for regular people who are, you know, cynical.
rotten	A Nicholas Sparks movie is like cinematic Jello. It sells well, the number one ingredient is sugar, and there's always room for it.
fresh	While the story wants to pretend it's about two fully realized individuals who battle their obstacles and fight for their love, it isn't.
rotten	Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones.
rotten	You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy.
fresh	A Sparks movie will never completely want for melodrama, but it's nice to find one where the melo- is a bit more mellow.
fresh	The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.
rotten	The only thing more grating than a Nicholas Sparks romance is two Nicholas Sparks romances bumping into each other.
rotten	As a romance, a drama, or even a sports movie, The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination.
rotten	The film has one story that kind of works, but is continually interrupted by one that doesn't. That has the effect of keeping The Longest Ride from ever achieving the meaning and relevance it so clearly aims for.
fresh	Look, it's easy to laugh at this stuff - that's part of the game, in fact. To buy into these movies, you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride, for all its ridiculousness, comes by its emotions honestly.
rotten	The Longest Ride is reasonably plain and inoffensive, but those are huge problems at this point. It's just not very sexy, or challenging, or different.
rotten	It sure was a long ride and one I would not care to take again.
fresh	Formulaic but still romantic Nicholas Sparks adaptation.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" is almost saved by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin...but not quite.
rotten	Like the big bowl of mac and cheese Luke says is his favorite dish, it's all mostly a bunch of squishy, deep-dish goo---but hey, it does look pretty good.
rotten	Truly, Sparks' Caucasian dreariness is a a force from which nothing, not even passably interesting directorial techniques can escape. A white hole, if you will.
rotten	You probably think The Longest Ride is about some mixture of young love and bull riding. If you think that, you are about half right.
rotten	You heard of "Star Wars"? Films based on Sparks' books could be called "Star-Crossed Wars."
rotten	a fantastical love story Sparks fans will probably love, made more endurable for the rest of us by a cast giving it more commitment than it's worth.
fresh	The two halves of "The Longest Ride" do not always smoothly congeal, but it is a sure bet that it will work for its target audience&#151;and likely a few skeptics as well.
fresh	The latest big-screen adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks' novel, and it's one of the better ones. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	It's a paint-by-numbers affair with an absurdly manipulative third act, barely managing to bring the heat with its mismatched co-stars. Perhaps the Sparks-faithful won't mind, but they certainly deserve better.
rotten	The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there.
rotten	Better than average for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but still pretty two-dimensional with an utterly ridiculous ending.
fresh	If men can swoon when muscle cars parachute from planes in "Furious 7," women should be able to enjoy the soothing fantasy of Sparks World, wherein true love, hard work and kind gestures are rewarded with enormous fortunes and nice houses.
rotten	Conducts an all out assault on your tear ducts with plenty of support from Alan Alda. I was almost ready to surrender. Almost.
rotten	People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In "The Longest Ride," authenticity is in short supply.
rotten	Eventful, polished, and knuckle-bitingly dull, the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks, combines fate, bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast.
fresh	It's well-made mush, this. As usual with these [Nicholas] Sparks adaptations, the corn is prepared and brought to the boil very carefully.
rotten	The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it.
rotten	Sparks' fans will eat it up, though, and that's who The Longest Ride is for, anyway.
rotten	Feels like The Notebook crashed into The Best of Me."
rotten	Both stories are weak -- and not just in the circumstances-over-character way of the Sparks universe.
rotten	"The Longest Ride" treats us to a twist that's so ridiculous I think we're almost supposed to laugh. It's not quite on the "Are you KIDDING ME!?" level of awfulness as the big reveal in "Safe Haven," but it's close. It's close.
rotten	It takes a lot to bore your easily entertained correspondent but rest assured The Longest Ride has the goods.
rotten	Far be it from me to spoil the plot, but since this is a Sparks story we're required to have at least one death, one scene of shirtless farm labour, one torrential downpour, one nugget of elderly wisdom and one improbable conclusion.
rotten	Alda adds gravitas, it's beautifully shot, and Eastwood is destined for stardom, but that's not enough to redeem The Longest Ride.
rotten	Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on earth - or even afterward? Let's just say Sparks works up to an ending that's as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable.
rotten	Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance.
fresh	Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected.
rotten	It tries to bridge the gap between pop culture and cultural elitism, between high art and the common commodity that everyone else buys tickets to see. A worthy goal, but it results in a movie that has none of the virtues of either.
rotten	just another Nicholas Sparks calamity
rotten	Unrelenting generic blandness
rotten	It runs a long 128 minutes. You have to wade through not just puddles of tears, but also piles of BS.
fresh	A sentimental movie with a message worth pondering about what it takes to keep love alive.
rotten	Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages.
rotten	The treacle flows for well over two hours, an interminable serving of the author's trademark schmaltz.
rotten	Conforms to a timeworn, and shopworn, Sparks formula of troubled protagonists receiving wisdom, or inspiration, or both, from unexpected sources.
fresh	It's exactly what you'd expect, except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.
fresh	The young Eastwood is better than you might expect, though it's Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance.
rotten	If this is your particular poison, it won't kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks' sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.
fresh	Sharply directed by Simon Curtis, the film is an intriguing mystery as, little by little, more and more information comes across the viewer's desk
rotten	Art-history aficionados might appreciate the debate over the legal and sentimental value of iconic paintings, but modern-day contrivances compromise much of the historical significance.
fresh	Helen Mirren delivers a strong performance in this predictable but well-crafted historical drama.
rotten	In their eagerness to make this into a feel-good story, Curtis and Campbell have turned their characters from multifaceted human beings into symbols who utter soundbites.
fresh	There is suspense, drama and emotion in this story. Reynolds and Mirren give great performances with good supporting performances by Daniel Bruhl, Katie Holmes and Allan Corduner.
fresh	Crusty octogenarian and exasperated man team up to wring justice from 50-yr-old wrongs. . .with charged interplay. . .to make legacy of Nazis' plunder of art a personal cause
fresh	We might not give this film much thought long after we have seen it... we will surely remember the beauty with which the past comes alive right before Maria's eyes.
rotten	It won't do the film any harm at the box office that Helen Mirren twinkles indomitably. She's as good as ever, but really - of all the things you want to see Dame Helen doing indomitably, twinkling isn't among them.
rotten	It makes a dull movie out of a fascinating piece of history.
fresh	Corny, commercial, predictably platitudinous, and tear-jerkingly weepy...also an inevitably thought-provoking dramatization of facing the 'ghosts' of the past on an individual level and a national one.
rotten	Your movie's flashback sub-plot shouldn't draw attention to how dull your actual central plot is.
rotten	Clearly, the most significant 'Woman in Gold' here is not the portrait nor Adele Bloch-Bauer herself (portrayed in flashback by Antje Traue) but our lead actress, the indomitable Oscar-winner, Helen Mirren,
fresh	The film is forgivably simplistic and sentimental but also stirring when it reminds us once again of the countless injustices from the Nazi era that can never be made right or forgotten.
fresh	A deeply moving and very satisfying piece of entertainment that knits up seemingly disparate elements in a tapestry of family pain and pride.
fresh	Helen Mirren is, of course, a wonderful actress, and she brings dignity to the marvellously Euro-chic Maria, but even she can't soar above the script which veers from speechifying to banalities.
rotten	Take a complex legal issue like the provenance of an art object, then throw in Helen Mirren and the Nazis as the hero and villains, and you have the dull and simplified tale of Woman in Gold.
fresh	Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes. This one really works.
fresh	Mirren's performance gains in depth and pathos as the film progresses.
fresh	There is much to recommend in Woman in Gold.
fresh	It's an intriguing David vs Goliath battle and Mirren positively glows with indignation.
fresh	This follows the fascinating story of Maria Altmann, a Jewish refugee who fled from Austria to escape the Nazi occupation of Vienna.
rotten	There's a terrible and relentless TV-movie ropiness about this film, combined with a dairy whiff of cheesiness.
fresh	Despite a debatable focus and dubious moralizing -money plays a pivotal role in the final outcome - "The Woman in Gold" works, largely because of the odd-couple chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds.
fresh	This fascinating true story is strong enough to hold up against the formulaic Hollywood treatment, boosted by another riveting performance from Helen Mirren...
rotten	In pursuit of prestige, it loses the qualities that make the story worth telling.
fresh	Curtis has so carefully crafted the film, and Mirren and Reynolds have such terrific chemistry, that it mostly works -- and it works pretty well at that.
fresh	Helen Mirren has become like Meryl Streep: nearly every time she has a leading role a little alarm goes off that signals Oscar gold.
rotten	Curtis' film stumbles in its digressions, lacking clear direction, along with the emotional impact it so desperately needs.
fresh	A conventional but powerful story.
fresh	Shrewdly compelling - with the incomprable Helen Mirren as the refined yet tartly obdurate propelling force.
fresh	The Helen Mirrens of the film world can often elevate whatsoever vehicle.
fresh	Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds make a great pair in this fascinating and true tale that makes for a highly entertaining and compelling tale.
rotten	Mirren is wonderful as always as the frank, spirited, adorable Maria, a shimmering bright spot as dazzling as the film's titular painting.
rotten	Director Simon Curtis is lucky to have Helen Mirren on hand, since she can turn the film's art history speeches into something that sounds like conversation. But the screenplay doesn't do either of them any favors.
rotten	Woman in Gold plays out like a filmic series of check-lists for legal and historical drama. It'll fit nicely into an AP Art History curriculum on a rainy day - only 20 flashbacks to go once you start.
fresh	Mirren is her usual stellar self, but the pleasant surprise here is Ryan Reynolds.
fresh	Helen Mirren is best part of fact-based historical drama.
fresh	This one only comes off as adequate and doesn't hit the emotional moments as hard as it should have. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)
rotten	Director Simon Curtis milks the predictable drama, thrills and heartache of the Holocaust-era story, but it's a paint-by-numbers triumph, a copy of something we've seen many times before.
rotten	"Woman in Gold" may be a bit obvious, but it's still a story worth telling.
rotten	Next to Mirren, [Reynolds is] like a dope in a museum, trying to be respectful of the genius around him but unable to sit still.
fresh	For all its broad brush strokes, Woman in Gold can't help but tell a moving populist parable about the will to power of an ordinary woman ... taking on powerful institutions to regain a tiny fraction of her family's appalling losses.
fresh	A wholly captivating Mirren makes Woman in Gold a positive film-going experience...
fresh	Mirren, sporting an accent that's about as close to Viennese as an English Dame can likely get, imbues Maria with pluck, high dignity and a vulnerability that's kept hidden beneath exterior reserve.
rotten	A movie that tells a real-life story yet rings utterly false.
rotten	Even boasting the pooled charisma of stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, Woman in Gold turns out to be a sputtering, clunky machine.
rotten	The Nazis' illegal seizure of hundreds of thousands of artworks -- the subject of the fine 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa -- becomes the pretext for heavy-handed sentimentality in this British-American docudrama.
fresh	Mirren is the single reason to watch the movie.
rotten	Based on a true story about a fight for justice wrapped in passion, memory and determination, and told using the considerable talents of Helen Mirren, Woman in Gold should be a much better movie.
rotten	Even Helen Mirren, the Queen Midas of class acting, can't fix this well-intentioned miss.
fresh	As with Pitch Perfect, the actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Banks herself, joined this time by Hailee Steinfeld - are the film's real charm, alongside those show-stopper a capella sequences, choreographed again by Aakomon Jones.
rotten	Heavy on music and light on story, Pitch Perfect 2 lacks the creativity that made the original so much fun.
fresh	Just as it was in the first film, the sequel is all about the shamelessly wicked one-note gags, delivered hard and fast between countless kooky renditions of songs you haven't heard for ages.
fresh	...sticks pretty close to the formula of its predecessor, but it's saved by its sly humour, with digs flying thick and fast.
fresh	It's the offbeat nature of the characters and their approach to the a cappella music they sing that gives this upbeat sequel edge. In musical terms, you might say it feels syncopated
fresh	Blythe Danner lands her best screen role in years as a retired widow who decides to dip a tentative toe into the dating pool in indie comedy I'll See You in My Dreams.
fresh	A polished piece of entertainment.
fresh	If there's one lesson the film attempts to convey, it's that there is always sweetness left in the world, no matter what, and this is a big piece of it.
fresh	This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over.
fresh	Blythe Danner gives a deeply felt performance as a widow slowly embracing the challenges of old age in this pleasant romantic dramedy.
fresh	The film becomes somewhat overwrought during its busy finale, but it's clever enough to be a candidate for cult status among genre aficionados who prize the pleasures of traditional storytelling.
fresh	a paradox-filled, reflexive plot
fresh	Like other Niccol films, particularly Gattaca, Good Kill is about an essential innocent who dreams of release from a highly structured, classist, and hypocritical environment.
fresh	Writer/director Andrew Niccol reteams with Gattaca star Ethan Hawke for this timely dramatic treatise on drone warfare.
fresh	It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own.
fresh	It's a surgical strike against US foreign adventurism and a devastating take-down of its "warheads-on-foreheads" policy, as well as a very moving a study of a soul in torment.
rotten	Plays like a series of didactic footnotes for a much more interesting film
fresh	Good Kill convincingly shows us a development in warfare that's only going to become ever more important, one that we've been preferring not to think too much about.
fresh	Niccol draws us into the fine details of this hidden military world and airs some meaty arguments about the appliance of science to the act of killing.
fresh	A sophisticated, provocative and thoroughly modern war film that makes Clint Eastwood's recent American Sniper look slow to find its target.
fresh	Hawke is quieter and more dour than he was playing the husbands and fathers in Linklater's films. However, he is very effective at capturing his character's pent-up frustration, self-disgust and mounting aggression.
fresh	The writer and director Andrew Niccol's quietly intelligent drama about drone warfare explores the gradual breakdown of a man's self-respect.
fresh	Hawke's effectively simmering performance helps create a potent and provocative report on how combat is mutating into a real-life video-game.
fresh	War being played out as a lethal video game is the fascinating subject for this cautionary thriller from director Andrew Niccol.
fresh	This smart and serious thinkpiece never loses sight of the overheads: the steep personal price paid by Egan, and the collateral damage incurred.
fresh	Doesn't shake you in your seat, but some very effective moments, and it poses some complex moral questions.
fresh	A sombre, intelligent drama that critiques Obama's ongoing drone policy while still positioning its button-pushing characters as tortured anti-heroes.
fresh	It's Top Gun with gamer's thumb. Ethan Hawke shines in a complex, satisfying character study turned combat thriller.
fresh	In the chill of computerised battle, there's an important film in here somewhere.
rotten	Hawke is on fine form - angry, volatile and confused. But for all Niccol's grappling with moral complexities he misses the target, veering into an overwhelmingly melodramatic subplot ...
fresh	Hawke gives a complex, sensitive portrayal and if Niccol sometimes flounders in externalising that inner conflict, it doesn't detract from the intensity.
fresh	Good Kill could've used more conflict and drama sprinkled throughout the narrative...
fresh	Unlike so many movies based on real events, this one arrives on time, not a few years too late.
fresh	There is, of course, no such thing as a "good kill". Andrew Niccol's drama will remind you of that, repeatedly.
rotten	Considering the premise, this could and SHOULD have been great.
fresh	When cinema reflects current conflicts, a certain aesthetic typically develops, and "Good Kill," Andrew Niccol's drone strike-era drama, makes a convincing case for the next phase of that evolution.
rotten	Heavy on speeches and light on actual drama.
rotten	In the face of such a weighty topic, Niccol proves a poor co-pilot for himself, as Good Kill's script fails to live up to a strong directorial effort.
fresh	Andrew Niccol takes on the topical issue of drone strikes in a tense war drama notable for its tact and intelligence.
fresh	Psychologically complex and unsettling ...
fresh	Fassbender makes a cool gunfighter/anti-hero, and New Zealand does a nice job doubling for America's Old West in this offbeat fable
fresh	Maclean shows a land where loss of innocence is ever-present.
fresh	One of the most thoughtful, witty, satisfying Westerns of the last decade.
fresh	Not a traditional Western by any stretch of the imagination, Slow West operates in the same manner as such haunting and off-kilter horse operas as Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man and John Hillcoat's The Proposition.
fresh	A neo-western that operates in purely mythic terms, Slow West evokes an 1870 America steeped in isolation, heartbreak, suffering, and misery.
rotten	A pageantry of pseudo-art poses, a self-consciously cool reorientation of the western as silly symphony.
fresh	While the ending doesn't exactly scream earned or original, it's a well-constructed piece that hawks back to films like "McLintock!" and "True Grit." A hypnotic film.
fresh	Sometimes the most old-fashioned way feels the freshest....It's as comfortable as a warm blanket by the fire, a sense that you're in good hands hearing a good yarn being told.
fresh	Slow West is defined by a kind of loving ambivalence -- about its hero, its genre, and perhaps most of all about a landscape so harsh and so beautiful it almost makes a man hope to die.
fresh	An absurdist, melancholy coming-of-age tale that jumps from odd comedy to striking violence to stirring reflection.
fresh	Thrilling euro-western with a darkly comic twist.
fresh	Slow West is a beautiful-looking film highlighted by its performances, with just the right amount of humor to make up for the flaws in its story structure.
fresh	This classic western myth is presented as more of a fairy tale, with absurd and surreal encounters dominating Jay and Silas's journey.
fresh	Using an economy of dialogue and striking visuals, Maclean tells a simple but soulful story that hits you with bursts of bloodshed and sharp gallows humor.
fresh	Slow-burning and simmering, "Slow West" knows how to kick the voltage into high gear.
fresh	Pitched somewhere between a David Fincher crime procedural, a Denis Lehane suspense novel and a Mommie Dearest melodrama, documentarian Amy Berg's move into the feature-length world of dramatic narrative is...an uneven one.
rotten	There's no shying away from the fact that the New Age, twig-built mumbo-jumbo peddled here is no match from the otherworldly ancient belief systems of Peru that flow through Llosa's earlier works.
rotten	The film's worst quality is its underhanded attempt to convey a complex recounting of one family's ordeal while fudging all the pertinent details.
rotten	Aloft stirs nothing within you, not emotionally, not provocatively.
rotten	Aloft is a meditative, thoughtful film, that wants to glide like a hawk into the sky and inspire us to wonder, but its narrative has feet of clay that all the wispy winsomeness cannot conceal.
fresh	Yet another splendid escape from the increasingly strenuous glut of computer-animated offerings, this one designed to serve as family entertainment after the more adult-skewing likes of "The Wind Rises" and "The Tale of Princess Kaguya".
fresh	As with Pitch Perfect, the actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Banks herself, joined this time by Hailee Steinfeld - are the film's real charm, alongside those show-stopper a capella sequences, choreographed again by Aakomon Jones.

fresh	Writer/director Andrew Niccol reteams with Gattaca star Ethan Hawke for this timely dramatic treatise on drone warfare.
fresh	It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own.
fresh	It's a surgical strike against US foreign adventurism and a devastating take-down of its "warheads-on-foreheads" policy, as well as a very moving a study of a soul in torment.
rotten	Plays like a series of didactic footnotes for a much more interesting film
fresh	Good Kill convincingly shows us a development in warfare that's only going to become ever more important, one that we've been preferring not to think too much about.
fresh	Niccol draws us into the fine details of this hidden military world and airs some meaty arguments about the appliance of science to the act of killing.
fresh	A sophisticated, provocative and thoroughly modern war film that makes Clint Eastwood's recent American Sniper look slow to find its target.
fresh	Hawke is quieter and more dour than he was playing the husbands and fathers in Linklater's films. However, he is very effective at capturing his character's pent-up frustration, self-disgust and mounting aggression.
fresh	The writer and director Andrew Niccol's quietly intelligent drama about drone warfare explores the gradual breakdown of a man's self-respect.
fresh	Hawke's effectively simmering performance helps create a potent and provocative report on how combat is mutating into a real-life video-game.
fresh	War being played out as a lethal video game is the fascinating subject for this cautionary thriller from director Andrew Niccol.
fresh	This smart and serious thinkpiece never loses sight of the overheads: the steep personal price paid by Egan, and the collateral damage incurred.
fresh	Doesn't shake you in your seat, but some very effective moments, and it poses some complex moral questions.
fresh	A sombre, intelligent drama that critiques Obama's ongoing drone policy while still positioning its button-pushing characters as tortured anti-heroes.
fresh	It's Top Gun with gamer's thumb. Ethan Hawke shines in a complex, satisfying character study turned combat thriller.
fresh	In the chill of computerised battle, there's an important film in here somewhere.
rotten	Hawke is on fine form - angry, volatile and confused. But for all Niccol's grappling with moral complexities he misses the target, veering into an overwhelmingly melodramatic subplot ...
fresh	Hawke gives a complex, sensitive portrayal and if Niccol sometimes flounders in externalising that inner conflict, it doesn't detract from the intensity.
fresh	Good Kill could've used more conflict and drama sprinkled throughout the narrative...
fresh	Unlike so many movies based on real events, this one arrives on time, not a few years too late.
fresh	There is, of course, no such thing as a "good kill". Andrew Niccol's drama will remind you of that, repeatedly.
rotten	Considering the premise, this could and SHOULD have been great.
fresh	When cinema reflects current conflicts, a certain aesthetic typically develops, and "Good Kill," Andrew Niccol's drone strike-era drama, makes a convincing case for the next phase of that evolution.
rotten	Heavy on speeches and light on actual drama.
rotten	In the face of such a weighty topic, Niccol proves a poor co-pilot for himself, as Good Kill's script fails to live up to a strong directorial effort.
fresh	Andrew Niccol takes on the topical issue of drone strikes in a tense war drama notable for its tact and intelligence.
fresh	Psychologically complex and unsettling ...
fresh	Fassbender makes a cool gunfighter/anti-hero, and New Zealand does a nice job doubling for America's Old West in this offbeat fable
fresh	Maclean shows a land where loss of innocence is ever-present.
fresh	One of the most thoughtful, witty, satisfying Westerns of the last decade.
fresh	Not a traditional Western by any stretch of the imagination, Slow West operates in the same manner as such haunting and off-kilter horse operas as Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man and John Hillcoat's The Proposition.
fresh	A neo-western that operates in purely mythic terms, Slow West evokes an 1870 America steeped in isolation, heartbreak, suffering, and misery.
rotten	A pageantry of pseudo-art poses, a self-consciously cool reorientation of the western as silly symphony.
fresh	While the ending doesn't exactly scream earned or original, it's a well-constructed piece that hawks back to films like "McLintock!" and "True Grit." A hypnotic film.
fresh	Sometimes the most old-fashioned way feels the freshest....It's as comfortable as a warm blanket by the fire, a sense that you're in good hands hearing a good yarn being told.
fresh	Slow West is defined by a kind of loving ambivalence -- about its hero, its genre, and perhaps most of all about a landscape so harsh and so beautiful it almost makes a man hope to die.
fresh	An absurdist, melancholy coming-of-age tale that jumps from odd comedy to striking violence to stirring reflection.
fresh	Thrilling euro-western with a darkly comic twist.
fresh	Slow West is a beautiful-looking film highlighted by its performances, with just the right amount of humor to make up for the flaws in its story structure.
fresh	This classic western myth is presented as more of a fairy tale, with absurd and surreal encounters dominating Jay and Silas's journey.
fresh	Using an economy of dialogue and striking visuals, Maclean tells a simple but soulful story that hits you with bursts of bloodshed and sharp gallows humor.
fresh	Slow-burning and simmering, "Slow West" knows how to kick the voltage into high gear.
fresh	Pitched somewhere between a David Fincher crime procedural, a Denis Lehane suspense novel and a Mommie Dearest melodrama, documentarian Amy Berg's move into the feature-length world of dramatic narrative is...an uneven one.
fresh	As with Pitch Perfect, the actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Banks herself, joined this time by Hailee Steinfeld - are the film's real charm, alongside those show-stopper a capella sequences, choreographed again by Aakomon Jones.
rotten	Heavy on music and light on story, Pitch Perfect 2 lacks the creativity that made the original so much fun.
fresh	Just as it was in the first film, the sequel is all about the shamelessly wicked one-note gags, delivered hard and fast between countless kooky renditions of songs you haven't heard for ages.
fresh	...sticks pretty close to the formula of its predecessor, but it's saved by its sly humour, with digs flying thick and fast.
fresh	It's the offbeat nature of the characters and their approach to the a cappella music they sing that gives this upbeat sequel edge. In musical terms, you might say it feels syncopated
fresh	Blythe Danner lands her best screen role in years as a retired widow who decides to dip a tentative toe into the dating pool in indie comedy I'll See You in My Dreams.
fresh	A polished piece of entertainment.
fresh	If there's one lesson the film attempts to convey, it's that there is always sweetness left in the world, no matter what, and this is a big piece of it.
fresh	This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over.
fresh	Blythe Danner gives a deeply felt performance as a widow slowly embracing the challenges of old age in this pleasant romantic dramedy.
fresh	The film becomes somewhat overwrought during its busy finale, but it's clever enough to be a candidate for cult status among genre aficionados who prize the pleasures of traditional storytelling.

fresh	Psychologically complex and unsettling ...
fresh	Fassbender makes a cool gunfighter/anti-hero, and New Zealand does a nice job doubling for America's Old West in this offbeat fable
fresh	Maclean shows a land where loss of innocence is ever-present.
fresh	One of the most thoughtful, witty, satisfying Westerns of the last decade.
fresh	Not a traditional Western by any stretch of the imagination, Slow West operates in the same manner as such haunting and off-kilter horse operas as Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man and John Hillcoat's The Proposition.
fresh	A neo-western that operates in purely mythic terms, Slow West evokes an 1870 America steeped in isolation, heartbreak, suffering, and misery.
rotten	A pageantry of pseudo-art poses, a self-consciously cool reorientation of the western as silly symphony.
fresh	While the ending doesn't exactly scream earned or original, it's a well-constructed piece that hawks back to films like "McLintock!" and "True Grit." A hypnotic film.
fresh	Sometimes the most old-fashioned way feels the freshest....It's as comfortable as a warm blanket by the fire, a sense that you're in good hands hearing a good yarn being told.
fresh	Slow West is defined by a kind of loving ambivalence -- about its hero, its genre, and perhaps most of all about a landscape so harsh and so beautiful it almost makes a man hope to die.
fresh	An absurdist, melancholy coming-of-age tale that jumps from odd comedy to striking violence to stirring reflection.
fresh	Thrilling euro-western with a darkly comic twist.
fresh	Slow West is a beautiful-looking film highlighted by its performances, with just the right amount of humor to make up for the flaws in its story structure.
fresh	This classic western myth is presented as more of a fairy tale, with absurd and surreal encounters dominating Jay and Silas's journey.
fresh	Using an economy of dialogue and striking visuals, Maclean tells a simple but soulful story that hits you with bursts of bloodshed and sharp gallows humor.
fresh	Slow-burning and simmering, "Slow West" knows how to kick the voltage into high gear.
fresh	Pitched somewhere between a David Fincher crime procedural, a Denis Lehane suspense novel and a Mommie Dearest melodrama, documentarian Amy Berg's move into the feature-length world of dramatic narrative is...an uneven one.
fresh	As with Pitch Perfect, the actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Banks herself, joined this time by Hailee Steinfeld - are the film's real charm, alongside those show-stopper a capella sequences, choreographed again by Aakomon Jones.
rotten	Heavy on music and light on story, Pitch Perfect 2 lacks the creativity that made the original so much fun.
fresh	Just as it was in the first film, the sequel is all about the shamelessly wicked one-note gags, delivered hard and fast between countless kooky renditions of songs you haven't heard for ages.
fresh	...sticks pretty close to the formula of its predecessor, but it's saved by its sly humour, with digs flying thick and fast.
fresh	It's the offbeat nature of the characters and their approach to the a cappella music they sing that gives this upbeat sequel edge. In musical terms, you might say it feels syncopated
fresh	Blythe Danner lands her best screen role in years as a retired widow who decides to dip a tentative toe into the dating pool in indie comedy I'll See You in My Dreams.
fresh	A polished piece of entertainment.
fresh	If there's one lesson the film attempts to convey, it's that there is always sweetness left in the world, no matter what, and this is a big piece of it.
fresh	This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over.
fresh	Blythe Danner gives a deeply felt performance as a widow slowly embracing the challenges of old age in this pleasant romantic dramedy.
fresh	The film becomes somewhat overwrought during its busy finale, but it's clever enough to be a candidate for cult status among genre aficionados who prize the pleasures of traditional storytelling.
fresh	a paradox-filled, reflexive plot
fresh	Like other Niccol films, particularly Gattaca, Good Kill is about an essential innocent who dreams of release from a highly structured, classist, and hypocritical environment.
fresh	Writer/director Andrew Niccol reteams with Gattaca star Ethan Hawke for this timely dramatic treatise on drone warfare.
fresh	It's nice to see the always compelling Hawke - here, tenser and more laconic than ever - in a role where his face's deep stress lines come into their own.
fresh	It's a surgical strike against US foreign adventurism and a devastating take-down of its "warheads-on-foreheads" policy, as well as a very moving a study of a soul in torment.
rotten	Plays like a series of didactic footnotes for a much more interesting film
fresh	Good Kill convincingly shows us a development in warfare that's only going to become ever more important, one that we've been preferring not to think too much about.
fresh	Niccol draws us into the fine details of this hidden military world and airs some meaty arguments about the appliance of science to the act of killing.
fresh	A sophisticated, provocative and thoroughly modern war film that makes Clint Eastwood's recent American Sniper look slow to find its target.
fresh	Hawke is quieter and more dour than he was playing the husbands and fathers in Linklater's films. However, he is very effective at capturing his character's pent-up frustration, self-disgust and mounting aggression.
fresh	The writer and director Andrew Niccol's quietly intelligent drama about drone warfare explores the gradual breakdown of a man's self-respect.
fresh	Hawke's effectively simmering performance helps create a potent and provocative report on how combat is mutating into a real-life video-game.
fresh	War being played out as a lethal video game is the fascinating subject for this cautionary thriller from director Andrew Niccol.
fresh	This smart and serious thinkpiece never loses sight of the overheads: the steep personal price paid by Egan, and the collateral damage incurred.
fresh	Doesn't shake you in your seat, but some very effective moments, and it poses some complex moral questions.
fresh	A sombre, intelligent drama that critiques Obama's ongoing drone policy while still positioning its button-pushing characters as tortured anti-heroes.
fresh	It's Top Gun with gamer's thumb. Ethan Hawke shines in a complex, satisfying character study turned combat thriller.
fresh	In the chill of computerised battle, there's an important film in here somewhere.
rotten	Hawke is on fine form - angry, volatile and confused. But for all Niccol's grappling with moral complexities he misses the target, veering into an overwhelmingly melodramatic subplot ...
fresh	Hawke gives a complex, sensitive portrayal and if Niccol sometimes flounders in externalising that inner conflict, it doesn't detract from the intensity.
fresh	Good Kill could've used more conflict and drama sprinkled throughout the narrative...
fresh	Unlike so many movies based on real events, this one arrives on time, not a few years too late.
fresh	There is, of course, no such thing as a "good kill". Andrew Niccol's drama will remind you of that, repeatedly.
rotten	Considering the premise, this could and SHOULD have been great.
